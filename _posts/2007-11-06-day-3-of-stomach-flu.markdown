<p>So I finally got up the strength to go the doctors.  I took a 10 minute cab to this place called Shu Tian Clinic.  Long story short.  It was lame.  I waited for 2 hours and they prescribed me useless drugs.  I was hoping for antibiotics, but they just gave me drugs to keep me from going.  Essentially artificial C-stop.  Did not fix the problem at all.</p>
<p>So I spent another night of crazy stomach aches and occasional trips to the bathroom along with an episode of roach killing.  I guess it was attracted to the dirtiness I had accumulated over the past three days.</p>
<p>One of my distant aunts (removed a bunch of times) came over today to make me some porridge.  It was very nice.  I haven't spoken face to face with someone in three days, so it was nice to have some company.  My mom is pretty worried about me, and I feel really sorry for her.  I think she feels helpless being so far away from me.  Both my aunt and Amos told me this will probably last a week.  That's tough news.  I hope I can catch up in school.</p>
<p>I also hope the roaches don't come back.</p>
<p>...I can't believe they didn't prescribe me anti biotics, what the crazy!?</p>
<p>and why in the world is my neck so stiff and painful?</p>
