<p>Three connected thoughts on the weight of words:</p>
<ul>
<li>The majority of my life is what it is either because of statements I have heard in sermons or sentences I have read in books.</li>
<li>To this day, I am still amazed that it is possible, with just one brief statement to clear away the clouds and bring out the Sun.</li>
<li>Pastor's should be encouraged, laypersons should be submissive, and unbelievers should listen.</li>
</ul>
