<p>I'm feeling a lot better these days.  I still wake up in cold sweats but other than that, life has returned to normal.</p>
<p>I extended my visa the other day that will expire in January.  Weird to be thinking I'll still be here in so long.  I also paid my water bill...at seven-eleven.</p>
<p>I'm happy.  I get to go to church today.</p>
<p>My parent's are coming in about a month, and my friend CT from highschool is coming to visit in a week and a half.  He's a harvard grad who only wears plaid and eats turkey and speaks in a british accent, okay none of that is true, but he is smart.</p>
<p>Ah, the mercy that is life.</p>
<p>oh, and for those of you who read this blog for the theology, I'm getting on it. I just need a little time to get the bolts back in the old noggin.</p>
