<p>When you think about the Lords' prayer, it sure seems like it. When you read the words "lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,"  there seems to be the implication that God is the one who controls whether or not we enter into temptation by means of either leading or delivering.</p>
<p>But immediately, the systematized student of the Bible will protest "It is against the nature of God to tempt man!" and I would answer, this is true. Indeed, the brother of our Savior says:</p>
<blockquote><p> “Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God”; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone.  But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust. ” (James 1:13,14 NAS95S)</p></blockquote>
<p>But here I must remind you concerning James' words, to remember that we are not only talking about lusts for sinful physical pleasures.  This concept applies to all sinful pleasures, mental, emotional, and materialistic.  The Arena of sin is after all much greater than the body and the senses.  When we are in difficult situations, are we not tempted to be anxious? When we face adversity, are we not tempted to despair? When we are rejected by our friends for the Gospel, are we not tempted to be frustrated and even bitter at God?  Notice how sin offers pleasure in every sphere of humanity, it is an ever present enemy to the Christian.</p>
<p>With that said, after understanding the prevalence of temptation in the Christian walk, I must say, as carefully as I can, God does indeed lead us through valleys of temptation.  When I read verses like, “No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man; and God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure it.” (1Cor 10:13 NAS95S)  The implication is that God does indeed allow us to be tempted, but within limits.  He brings times of trial into the Christians life which cause him to stand toe to toe with the temptation to either give up on God or cling to His promises.  The greatest example I can think of is persecution such as that experienced by the Apostle Paul.  I for one would be tempted to deny God or disbelieve His promise "all things work together for the good of those who love Me" if I felt the lash of the scourge over and over again upon my bare back.  But this was exactly the plan God had for Paul from the start. “for I will show him how much he must suffer for My name’s sake.””(Acts 9:16 NAS95S) Truly, in every refinement of the saint's soul, there is a point of temptation where he may disbelieve in God, distrust Him, and so sin against Him.</p>
<p>Now let's return to the verse.  Can it still be understood in such a way that James 1:13,14 is maintained in its potency of meaning while simultaneously preserving the natural reading of Luke 11:4? I think so.  Notice that not once here have I said that God is the tempter.  That is blasphemous and heretical.  However I will say that God is the shepherd who sometimes leads the sheep through valleys of death.  I believe that.  I drew this diagram while sitting in the pews at church a few weeks ago.  It helped me, maybe it will help you.</p>

<p>Notice how God does not do the tempting but rather leads us through it.  The shepherd leads his sheep through the valley of death and God  leads us through temptation. He does this with the aim that our souls might be purified and our faith strengthened.</p>
<p>We should not ask for temptations, we do not want them, but God will lead us through them.  And when he does, remember, "Thy staff and rod, they comfort me." Just as God can "lead us into...", he can "deliver us from ..."  Now let's listen to James again:</p>
<blockquote><p>“  Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.”<br />
(James 1:2-4 NAS95S)</p></blockquote>
