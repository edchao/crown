<p>Have you ever been afraid to invite your friend to a fellowship of believers because you&#39;re afraid that some of the guys will start hitting on her or trying to start a relationship with her?&nbsp; or perhaps, if it is a guy, you&#39;re afraid some the girls might start whispering to one another about how handsome he is?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doesn&#39;t it make you feel sick?&nbsp; It&#39;s like wolves feeding on a helpless ewe lamb. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But to be quite honest, you and I sometimes join the pack.&nbsp; I&#39;m sorry.</p>
