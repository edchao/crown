<p>for the moment here is a snippet of Galatians 3 translated!</p>
<blockquote><p> O Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whom according to the eyes, Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed (as) crucified.  This only I desire to learn from you.  Out of works of the law did you receive the spirit or out of faithfully hearing? So foolish are you , having begun by the spirit, are you now by the flesh being perfected?  Did you suffer so greatly in vain? If it was in vain.  Therefore is the one who provides to you the spirit and works with power in you, (do it) out of works of the law or out of hearing faithfully.  Just as Abraham believed in God and it was counted to him for the purpose of righteousness.</p></blockquote>
