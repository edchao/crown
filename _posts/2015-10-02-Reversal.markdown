> He who steals must steal no longer; but rather he must labor, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have something to share with one who has need. (Ephesians 4:28)

The Christian reverses the vices of his formal self. The thief who takes from the fruit of other’s labor for his own enjoyment, when converted, gives of the fruit of his own labor for the enjoyment of others. What is your vice? What is its reversal? The liar speaks truth. The unwholesome edifies with words of grace. The angry turns to tender-heartedness.
