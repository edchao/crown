<p>Ever say stuff that you feel like you need to qualify?Â  Sometimes our calvinistic tendencies cause us to go back on what we said and restate it another time with a more calvinistic bent. For example "When you choose God by faith, or rather... when He chooses you through bestowing faith." Well Paul does it too! This is Galatians 4:9:</p>
<p>"But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, "</p>
