<blockquote>"3 While people are saying, “There is peace and security,” then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. 4 But you are not in darkness, brothers, for that day to surprise you like a thief. 5 For you are all children of light, children of (the) day. We are not of (the) night or of (the) darkness. 6 So then let us not sleep, as others do, but let us keep awake and be sober. 7 For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, are drunk at night. 8 But since we are of (the) day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation. 9 For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 10 who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we might live with him. 11 Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing." - 1 Thess 5:3-10</p></blockquote>
<p>I used to be very confused by this pasage.  All this talk of day and night, used to make me wonder whether Christians ought to sleep lightly, and be serious people.  Don't laugh, it's what I really thought.  After all isn't Paul saying that the moment Christ comes back is a mystery? and wouldn't you want to be awake for when that happens?  And he does mean literally awake right?</p>
<p>Thankfully the right interpretation of this passage does not have to do with literal wakefulness. phew! If you take notice, the repetition of the word Day is important.  "That day to surprise you like a thief" "children of the day" "we belong to the day".  Likewise the repetition of the word Night, "We are not of the night". "those who sleep, sleep at night, those who get drunk, get drunk at night"</p>
<p><strong>1.There are two time periods</strong></p>
<p>Presently we are in the time period of "Darkness" or  "The Night."  We know this because it is compared to the other time period of "Light" or  more specifically, "The Day".  Notice the comparison between darkness and "that day".  "But you are not in darkness brothers, for that day to surprise you like a thief."  This is a passage about the point in time when the age of Darkness peels back and Light shines in, it is The Day of the coming of the Lord!</p>
<p><strong>2.There are two types of people</strong></p>
<p>There are two types of people in this passage.  Those who are "of day"  and "of night".   The use of the genitive (signaled by the of) is most likely something along the lines of a genitive of possession, in other words, the children belong to the day.  This could also be a use of genitive of quality, which could be understood as they are day-ful in nature.  The original text does not place the definite article "the" in the phrase "children of (the) day."  However, its proximity to "The Day" which is very much emphasized  by the definite article as singular and significant, as well as the sharing of the same word "hemera", holds the two in close connection.  The Day of the coming of Christ, is the start of the period of light, this period is the home, the natural environment, of the children of light.</p>
<p>The children of darkness / night, are the exact opposite of the children of day.  They don't belong to the day.  When Jesus returns to earth on The Day, and light breaks forth, these people will suddenly be thrown into an environment that absolutely does not suit them.  Christ will bring in an age of accountability, judgment, and righteousness, and those who live in sin will simply not know what to do or how to go on.  Because the children of night belong to this present age where sin is allowed to run rampant, where secret transgressions are continuously committed without shame.  Paul paints a picture using the examples of drunkenness and sleep.  Drunkenness illustrates blatant sin, complete lack of inhibition and control.  Sleep illustrates the lack of awareness, moral apathy, eyes closed.  People are walking around shrugging off moral law like a sleeper shrugs off the poking of someone trying to wake them.</p>
<p><strong>3.One type of people does not belong</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight:normal;">The point of this passage is that one type of person does not belong.  Christians are the children of light and they should not be tempted to join up with the children of darkness in their sinful behaviors.  True, Jesus has not yet come, but just because the Day has not yet begun, doesn't mean the day-walkers should live as though they are night-walkers.  Rather, Christians, in the midst of this present darkness, should be sober-minded (understanding the reality of the sin and darkness around them).  When we face the attacks of temptation, we should be full of faith, believing with conviction the words and character of Christ which then expresses itself in love. And what keeps our heads on our shoulders? The hope of our salvation, the hope that the Day of awesome light will pour out on us someday.  And why should we behave this way? because God has made a promise through Christ, that this salvation is destined for us!  so that whether we flounder in sin or run in faithfulness (still working on this interpretation), when He comes we will still be caught up with Him into true and eternal life.  Therefore keep pushing forward, renew your resolve again and again.</span></strong></p>
