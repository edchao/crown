<p>That's what I wish I could write about in my research paper.  Unfortunately I don't think it will fly.  I'm taking a class on the Abrahamic connection between Islam, Judaism, and Christianity and I need to come up with a research paper topic by tommorow.</p>
<p>But the more I think about it, the more I realize that it is impossible for the three Abrahamic religions to stand in tension without the compromise of their doctrinal integrity.  In class, all that seems to be discussed in the lecture in regard to their differences is historical facts, or obscure geneologies.  And in the light of such minute differences, they build their hopes that all three religions can join hands and unite to make the world a better place.</p>
<p>They have missed the largest and most definitive issue, the way to salvation. Or perhaps to put it in a more general way, dealing with the relationship between man and God.  Islam, Judaism, and Christianity will never fit together because all of them are fundamentally different in this regard.  No matter how much we may agree on the person of Abraham, if we do not agree on the person of God, and if we do not agree about who we are in relation to Him, there is no real meaningful agreement at all.</p>
<p>No tension exists between these 3 religions because God never meant there to be one.  If the Lord divinely established one way to salvation, which he has if Christ's words are true, or even if Muhammad's words are true, then there can be no tension.  Call me a fundamentalist, but I think it's just plain A is not equal to A + B + C.</p>
