I’ve heard it said that the constancy with which we engage in prayer is a barometer for our reliance upon God. What is totally crazy is that we, weak and helpless humans, forget to rely on God through prayer, all the time. While Jesus, who was God Himself, was constant in prayer. If even the Almighty incarnate supplicated the Almighty above, then shouldn’t we, who are far more needy, pray all the more?
