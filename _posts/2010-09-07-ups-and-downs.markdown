<p>I've been thinking that a lot of my ups and downs in life are reactionary.  If something good happens it pushes me up, and if something bad happens I plummet, lots of downs = lots of plummeting. What does that say about my spiritual life?! That even after all these years, it is circumstantial and external, and perhaps merely convenient.  If people fail, expectations go unmet, and life becomes burdensome, does not Christ look more faithful, His promises look more sure, and His daily grace more lavish?  The valley indeed brings out the heights if you are willing to lift your eyes.</p>
<blockquote><p>Soul, then know thy full salvation, rise o'er sin and fear and care, joy to find in every station, something still to do or bear.</p>
<p>Think what Spirit dwells within thee, what a Father's smiles are thine. Think how Jesus died to win thee, child of heav'n shouldst thou repine?</p></blockquote>
