<p>so as many of you know, i've finished school.  I've turned in my last project, gotten my last set of grades and finalized my GPA.  And I'm still here in L.A.  One quarter left before I hop on a plane and leave this place.  Of course, I've applied to a few internships,and  Lord willing I'll get one of them for this next quarter.  But apart from that, now that the application part is over, there's not much else.  Of course there's ministry, and I've not given up on that but beyond that in terms of responsibilities, that's pretty much it.</p>
<p>I've come to realize that now when school is over and done with, all my aspirations and dreams are finally before me and its up to me to make things happen.  If I really want it, nobody but me is going to help me get it.  No settling, not letting things go.  I am in a stage of life where I can either just react to what comes my way, let life pass me by and just let myself go with the flow, or say "Stop, No, I am making a decision, this is not what I want, this is," and then actively push in that direction.  Today, determination and decision is the name of the game.  In school, it used to just be discipline and performance.</p>
<p>That's a mouthful of me-power but take that with a grain of theological salt.  I am a man, and I make plans, but in the end I trust that it is the purpose of the Lord that will stand.  We all know that He will faithfully guide my steps according to his sovereign purpose. And so with that knowledge, as I make my plans and put my foot down on decisions, that's my confidence.  And of course, the presupposition of all this is "Delight yourself in the Lord." Don't worry, I haven't forgotten.</p>
