<p>Serving the body of Christ can be an enjoyable thing, and make no mistake, it should be.  However in these last few years, I have come to the conviction that the gauge of service cannot be determined by sheer enjoyment as we often can rate what is enjoyable and what is not.  There needs to be a clarification as to how enjoyment and service intertwine.  It is not the service itself that should provide the enjoyment but the deeper, eternal impact to which the service paves a way.</p>
<p>So what does that mean practically?</p>
<p>Let's look at an example. I must say that purchasing things for someone whether that be lunch dinner or snacks, movie tickets, or  anything at all for that matter is a very vague form of service.  I mean, I can see how it could be a loving act and certainly it is always appreciated on the receiving end, but is it necessarily always service?  Just because someone is known for treating others out, is it a surefire sign of care or love?  How about hanging out with fellow believers?  "Fellowshipping" we call it.  Is that a measure of service? There are a number of activities that fall beneath these two categories and both of these categories fall underneath a single larger circle I like to call "Fun things to do."  You see, if your ministry is only composed of "Fun things to do" what makes you any different than an unbelieving friend who likes to have fun and is generous with his money and time?</p>
<p>It's no fight against the flesh to have fun.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that these forms of service are illegitimate at all times,  but I would say that if your ministry is composed entirely of these things, you ought to be questioning whether you have a heart for serving others or just a heart for having fun.</p>
<p>If however, your enjoyment is placed in the appreciation and apprehension of the glory of God, it doesn't matter whether you are serving in a soup kitchen or scrubbing the bathroom floor, you will find joy.  You see, it may not be fun, but in your act of painful service the Lord is being magnified because nothing shows love like sacrifice and nothing shows sacrifice like discomfort.  Show me a man who puts himself constantly in discomfort for the sake of the Lord and I will show you a man who truly ministers to the glory of God.  But show me a man who's ministry is composed of nothing more than providing fun, food, and "fellowship" and I will show you a man no different than a generous unbeliever.</p>
<p>So next time you splurge on Korean BBQ, or gather your friends together to hangout or watch a movie, or make dinner for the freshman, don't start thinking you've legitimated your service to the Lord.  Because no matter how much money you spend on people, you can never buy true care.  And no matter how much time you spend hanging out or going places, it will never amount to love.</p>
<p>If you want to show love, if you want to truly serve, you make a sacrifice and real sacrifices hurt.  That means denying yourself.</p>
<p>So here's the final word. Only believers will deny themselves to serve others.  Are you showing yourself to be a believer in your service?</p>
