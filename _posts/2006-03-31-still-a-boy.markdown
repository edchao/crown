<p>I am 21 years old.</p>
<p>I know that i am supposed to be strong and stable, have a thick skin and have the charisma to lead people and have them depend on me. I should be like Edwards and Spurgeon, great men of God by the time they were in their early teens. You know I wish I were.</p>
<p>But I am frail, easily broken, and often laid low. If you push me to hard you will crush me and if I get too nervous I will show it. On top of that I am not humble, I am prideful and I turn my attention to myself before I turn it to others. I am susceptible to flattery and losing self-control. I turn difficult situations into chaos and make comfortable situations awkward and that's only the tip of the iceberg. I am a bad friend, a bad brother and a negligent son. I am a failure when it comes to loving others and a shameful success at loving myself. And you know... It gets worse if I get angry.</p>
<p>so I stand in awe of men like John Piper, who have proven themselves not day after day but moment after moment to be truly men of God.<br />
(don't start with me, you know I give credit to the Lord Almighty who gives grace to men such as Piper so that they can be so mature in Christ. Boy I hate giving theology disclaimers.)</p>
