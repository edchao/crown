<p>I have a lot of plans in life.  Most of them change.  So I have decided to stop stating absolutes in terms of what I will do or where I will go because I realize not only is it rare that I can follow up on them, I am also not the Sovereign and I do not have an irresistable will (according to which all things must necessarily occur).  I have no say in absolutes.  What a surprise.</p>
<p>...But the Purpose of the Lord will stand.</p>
