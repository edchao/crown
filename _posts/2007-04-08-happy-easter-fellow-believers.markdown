<p>If Christ has not been raised, our preaching, our faith, our witness, is worthless,we are still in our sins and all who have died before us have perished. And we Christians are the most pitiable and tragic of all people.</p>
<p>But, He is risen, even as He said.</p>
<blockquote><p>““DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP in victory. “O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY? O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR STING?” The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law; but thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.”(1Cor 15:54-57 NAS95S)</p></blockquote>
