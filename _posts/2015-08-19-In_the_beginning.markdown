> And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.
(Genesis 1:3 ESV)

We've recently started doing family Bible reading around the breakfast table. And we figured that we'd start at the beginning. Yesterday was Day 1, and what you'd expect to be old hat (the creation account) was anything but! It was so fresh to read it aloud, and notice things so easily glossed over. Of particular note is that God spoke, and it happened. And it's emphasized over and over in the text. The phrase "and it was so" appears six times in Genesis 1, because when God speaks, it happens! What a powerful God we worship.
