<p>It's hard to describe, but we all know it, and deep inside of us, we all appreciate it.  But despite its many portrayals in movies and novels alike, Honor is rarely if ever displayed in our personal lives.  That's a real tragedy.  I  believe that Honor  is something that men and women of every race and creed long to know.  And when they lose sight of it, due to various circumstances, they lose a piece of themselves in the process.</p>
<p>Life is mundane. But Life spent for things beyond ourselves, kindness, charity, integrity, humility, selflessness, loyalty, generosity,  chivalry, brotherhood... things that we cannot quantify, and yet things that add so much meaning to our lives, transform the mundane into the meaningful.</p>
