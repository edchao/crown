> And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; 13 until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. 

Upon His ascension, Jesus gave to the Church some empowered groups of individuals (Apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers). Jesus gave these individuals (note “gave” is aorist tense, past event, simple aspect) to equip believers for service in growing the Church. My question arises here, did Jesus give these individuals once? Or does he continue to give them to the Church? If he continues to give them to the church, is there any evidence that some are no longer given? If some, why?

The interesting thing is that the following verse, which describes the result of attaining maturity in Christ, is a present-day prescription to no longer be tossed about by every wind of doctrine. So that means that either we have attained this “maturity,” or we have attained it to such a degree that it is functionally able to hold us fast in the storms of doctrinal controversy. If this is the case, then I feel comfortable with the idea that these empowered individuals in part or in whole are no longer given to the Church today.
