<p>ever pick up a gospel tract with pictures of hell and people walking into the mouth of a gigantic flaming skull? I have.  How do I feel about that?</p>
<p>Well, I feel two things. First, I feel put off.  Secondly, I feel sorry.  I feel put off because the message of the tract seems to "revel in" rather than "revere" the wrath and Justice of God.  Though I am an unapologetic about God's wrath, that doesn't mean I enjoy morbidly depicting hell for people.</p>
<p>I feel sorry, because many are getting a wrong image of who God is as well as the call of the Gospel (the good News).  The call of the Gospel is one of compassion, deep sorrow, and the most powerful joy.  It is one that confronts sinners and reveals their sin, but not with caricatures or words of ridicule.  The reality of Sin is tragic and there are far too many misunderstanding of what it is. We don't need more imaginitive portrayals of what it looks like.</p>
<p>I have a lot more to say but in order to make this post short, I'll just say this.  You don't need to make the Gospel into a comic book and lay it as a trap for people to read it.  Rather, you need more people who are willing to put their life on the line and possibly take the grief of rejection and ridicule.  Comic books are for entertainment.  Jesus is not a matter of entertainment.</p>
<p>For those who are wondering then, what IS the gospel?.  Here, I don't need a comic book to say this.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>There is a God who made us.  </b>As His creation we were made to be with and enjoy Him through honoring Him and loving Him.</li>
<li>However <b>the world chooses not honor God,</b> <b>we reject Him</b> and His words.  To be honest, we do more than reject...we ridicule and mock, even denying their existence.  Therefore we are Sinners.</li>
<li>As sinners, we feel the shame and guilt and regret of our sin.  Some of us, even feel like we deserve to be punished.  Those feelings only prove that we have truly done something wrong.  God is a God of Kindness and Love, but He is also a God of perfect Justice who, <b>as the ultimate Standard and Judge of Right and Wrong, must punish sinners.</b>  So in the face of all our sin, we are therefore waiting for our punishment which may fall on us at any point in time, (since you don't know when you die.)</li>
<li>This is where the good news comes in.  Remember I said God was a God of love and kindness?  I wasn't kidding.  He sent his only Son Jesus, to die the death of a criminal on a cross.  On that cross he offered up a sacrifice... a payment, for sin by absorbing the full blow of God's wrath upon his own body.  <b>Christ's payment for sin was a gift.  It is offered to all.  I</b>f we are willing to accept it by faith, it is ours.  Our sins are paid for.  And if we are paid for, we are not our own, but Christ's, whom we now live for.</li>
<li>That's the Gospel.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>note: Now, I know most of us think we're not that bad.  But let's say you sinned only once a day (which is downright amazing), that's 365 sins a year.  Compound that with say..60 years of your life.  21,900 sins.  That's a lot of sin already. Increase it to two sins a year, and you get 43,800. Ouch. Nobody is as good as they think. But let's not play the number game.  Simply stated, all of us are habitual sinners, and none of us have the power to erase what we've done.</i>  <i>Furthermore, you can do as much good as you want, but doing good doesn't erase the past. For all that sin, somebody's got to pay.  </i></p>
