<p>Met a guy on skid row tonight, he sang me a song before we parted ways, the refrain went like this.</p>
<p><em>"you can't give, love,  if you can't see, love.</em>"</p>
<p>I don't think he meant it this way, but theologically, it's true that if you cannot see and comprehend the love of Christ in his cross-work you cannot then give real love away.</p>
<blockquote><p>“ Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love. <strong>By this the love of God was manifested in us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world so that we might live through Him.</strong> In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has seen God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us. By this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit. We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.” (1John 4:7-14 NAS95S)</p></blockquote>
