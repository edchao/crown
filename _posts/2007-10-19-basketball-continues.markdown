<p>I haven't posted in a few days.  So here's something fresh.  I found someone people to play ball with and there are a couple courts next to my campus with pick up games.  I miss the sunset days though.  man...I miss those days.  If you still go out on Saturday mornings or weekday nights, shoot a couple threes for me and as the ball is in the air about to fall seamlessly through the hope give a holler, "for Ed Chao's future wife." </p>
<p>Thanks, I'd appreciate the gesture. Not that I believe in any prophetic power in balls swishing through baskets or anything...</p>
