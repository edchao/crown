<p>As a homebody, I am irrevocably attached to whatever is familiar.  And whenever I lose a piece of my wonderfully familiar world, it makes me sad.</p>
<p>My brother got married yesterday.  I know I haven't lost him, but I did lose something familiar. No worries, I'm happy for him, and I know that he is very very happy now which makes me vicariously happy too.  I'm just hoping that this new unfamiliar bit of "my world" becomes a better familiar bit in time.</p>
<p>Oh, and something entertaining for you all.  I led my mom up to the altar to light one of the two candles candles bordering the central unlit unity candle.  But I was confused and almost made my mom light the unity candle, in fact I aggressively prompted her for a solid 5 seconds before the stares of an alarmed congregation made me realize what I was attempting to do was horribly wrong.</p>
<p>congratulations Jon and Carol.</p>
<p>May your marriage be awesome.</p>
