> Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness, looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be destroyed by burning, and the elements will melt with intense heat! But according to His promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells. (2 Peter 3:11-13)

I first read this passage my freshman year of college, and it has stuck with me all these years. The world as we know it will pass away with the deafening roar of a global conflagration. In view of this reality, each day let me ask myself the question, "What sort of person ought I to be?"  A man of holy conduct, godliness, and a insatiable expectation to look, to look, to look for the day of God and for the new heavens and earth, where righteousness at long last finds its home.
