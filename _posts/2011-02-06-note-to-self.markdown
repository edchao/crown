<p>Regardless of the situation,</p>
<p><strong>1. Don't live in fear. </strong> All things serve your best eternal interest no matter how awful they may appear.</p>
<p><strong>2. Never give up hope.</strong> Your future is secure in Christ and that future is Joy.</p>
<p><strong>3. Take your time and pray</strong>. Don't rush to conclusions, Wisdom will come to the heart that has carefully bound itself with God.</p>
