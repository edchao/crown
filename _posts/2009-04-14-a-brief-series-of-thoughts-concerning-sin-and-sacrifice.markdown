<p>Thought 1. Sin is a tremendous problem.  Its effect upon our souls is infinitely severe.</p>
<p>Thought 2. For a problem of infinite severity you must either have infinitely numerous solutions each with limited effect OR a single solution with infinite effect.</p>
<p>Thought 3. In the Old Testament, under the Mosaic Law, Israel sought to propitiate their sins by means of numerous sacrifices of limited effect, year after year.  But even after many thousands of years, the vast number of sacrifices could no less touch infinity than when they first began.  So even though the sacrifices were of valid effect, they could never fill the boundless void of Sin's cost.</p>
<p>Thought 4. The boundless cost of Sin, is satisfied by the boundless worth of God. Christ was this boundless worth clothed with humanity.  For there contained in one Man, was the infinity that all men could never attain.  With a single sacrifice of unlimited effect, The God Man paid the infinite price for our Sin.</p>
<p>EDIT: And that explains how sacrifices<strong> <em>can b</em><em>e </em></strong>effectual while also being insufficient.</p>
