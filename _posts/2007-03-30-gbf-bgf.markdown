<p>I am hereby coining the terms GBF and BGF.</p>
<p>GBF meaning a Girl who acts like a boyfriend and BGF meaning a boy who acts like a girlfriend. These can be applied to a variety of relational circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>"GBF" :</strong></p>
<p>For girls, sometimes you have these girl friends that you treat like your boyfriend, its really disturbing but this is very common. For guys, sometimes you have friends that are girls that you are so tight with that they are almost like one of the fellas. Both of those are GBF.</p>
<p><strong>"BGF":</strong></p>
<p>It goes the other way around too. Sometimes a guy is to a girl, just like one of the sistas. This is the most shameful of all but it is also very common. These may be considered the "safe" guys. They are in relational limbo. Also, sometimes guys take brotherhood to the n'th degree such that it is uncomfortably ambiguous. Both of these cases may be considered BGF.</p>
<p>okay. Have a nice remainder of the break.  This is what graduated people think about.</p>
