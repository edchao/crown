<p>I was thinking about it the other day and I realized that one of the things that makes exegesis so amazing is this:  Exegesis, the study of Scripture which leads out its meaning, is the study of the very Rationale of God.  As we study the flow of argument from verse to verse, we are studying the very thought process of God, the stream of His divine Reason.</p>
<p>Breathtaking...</p>
<p>The mind of infinite wisdom is here with us.  In fact, it's here with me, sitting on my desk, waiting to be read and understood.  Okay, I'm going to go study.</p>
