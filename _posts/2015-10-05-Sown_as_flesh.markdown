> â€¦you do not sow the body which is to be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat or of something else. But God gives it a body just as He wished, and to each of the seeds a body of its own. All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish. (1 Corinthians 15:37-39)

The human body is sown as the flesh of man, and comes to life, after death, as a heavenly body. I wonder what comes to life from the flesh of beasts, birds, and fish?
