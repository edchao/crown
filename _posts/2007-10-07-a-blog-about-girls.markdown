<p>Okay.  Deep breath.  Don't freak out.   -_-</p>
<p>Here we go.  Men are suckers for looks.  We admit it... okay, I admit it on behalf of all of us.   And until today, I couldn't let that factor go.  It just seemed so obvious, so integral.  Nobody wants to get married to someone they aren't attracted to right?</p>
<p>right.  No qualms there.</p>
<p>But, more and more these days.  Especially as I've been walking around in Taiwan with a thousand relatively good looking people walking around me, I have come to the conviction that looks really are empty.  I see people try so hard to attain physical beauty, or strain their wallets to preserve it, but it's gotta go someday.  There's just no stopping it.  Okay, Solomon, I know you wrote it a couple thousand years back, but I just didn't buy it for some reason.  So here I am.  Finally agreeing.  Beauty is indeed vain.  In other words, it amounts to nothing.  Attraction should begin with the interaction of hearts first and foremost... and looks?...well, that's a bonus.</p>
<p>Here's one way to simplify it, which I think everyone will agree with (change the gender accordingly): it's far better to marry a girl who you love talking to because of the beauty of her heart than to marry a girl who you love talking to because of the make of her face.</p>
<p>I figure the former beauty will outlast the latter, the former conversation will outlast the latter, and more importantly, the former love will be deeper than the latter.</p>
<blockquote><p>“      *An excellent wife who can find?<br />
She is far more precious than jewels.<br />
The heart of her husband trusts in her,<br />
and he will have no lack of gain.”<br />
(Prov 31:10-11 ESV)</p></blockquote>
<p>(PS. For all you mischievous instigators, nothing cataclysmic happened today to cause me to write this entry.  The thought just finally settled in my head, that's all, you lamers.)</p>
