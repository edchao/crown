<p>that's what we've got, a wish list and a reality list.</p>
<p>We all have wishes and dreams for what we want our life to look like but we know that in all reality, that list won't be full of check marks.  Reality seems much colder, much less fulfilling, much more apprehensive and hard to accept.  Our wish list is completely different, it's romantic, idealistic, and in it all of our dreams come true.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's hard to wake up in the morning when your wish list has been aching in your head all night.  I think the one thing that cracks open the door of hope is that I know some day my wish list will look like pitiful scraps compared to the banquetting feast which will be God's list for me, which he will one day reveal, and it will be full of checks.</p>
<p>What gives me even more hope and opens further the crack, is that the Lord's list, containing his divine purposes, is currently being checked off now, even in this life, though it presently seems to be nothing more than a cold reality.</p>
<p>We will see it someday and gasp. And the purposes of God, which seemed in our first life to be a solid veil will become as crystal, shining and radiant to the heart and mind.</p>
