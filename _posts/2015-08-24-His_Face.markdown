> He was despised, and we did not esteem Him, like one from whom men hide their face,  (Isaiah 53:3)

So great was Jesus' grief and suffering, passersby avoided looking at his face. How incredible that this same face would become to us, the greatest reward to behold. â€œThey will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads." (Rev 22:4)
