<p>Psalm 42:1-2 </p>
<p>As a deer pants for flowing streams,<br />
so pants my soul for you, O God.<br />
My soul thirsts for God,<br />
for the living God.</p>
<p>is answered in Rev 22:17</p>
<p>The Spirit and the Bride say, “Come.” And let the one who hears say, “Come.” And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the water of life without price.</p>
