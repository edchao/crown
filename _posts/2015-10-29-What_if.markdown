> Supposing the Straight was utterly powerless, always and everywhere certain to be mocked, tortured, and finally killed by the Crooked, what then? Why not go down with the ship? (C.S. Lewis, That Hideous Strength)

What a thought. If the right side were powerless and destined to always and ultimately lose at the hand of the wrong side, would you still stand with it? If signing up to be a Christian did not promise eternal happiness, but only the knowledge that you had done what was right and took up the mantle of good, would you still confess Christ as Lord? Strip away the blessings, the promises, and the victory, and then you can truly measure the genuiness of your conviction: that to be on the side of God is reward enough.
