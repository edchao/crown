My dog is not trustworthy. If I take off her leash, there's a pretty big chance she'll run off. It's pretty unfortunate because if I knew she would come back when called, she could have total freedom. As it stands, her own willfullness prevents her from experience greater happiness. 

We're basically the same. When left to our own devices we will ultimately destroy ourselves. It is only after we learn to obey God that we can know true freedom and joy.
