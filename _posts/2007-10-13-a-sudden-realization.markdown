<p>I woke up today a little late.  I had turned off the alarm (I never snooze) and had slept a few minutes too many.  So I threw back the covers and hopped off my bed.  Checked my email and looked over some of my homework.  I decided to blog a little bit because the night before I had trouble falling asleep because of this thought that kept pressing me concerning the passage, Rom 8:28.  I jumped in the shower after that and as I was showering contemplated if I had finished all the homework and if I was ready to take the test for the next chapters vocab.  It was about 9:15 by then and I figured it was about time to make breakfast if I was going to make it to school on time.  And then the sudden and most wonderful realization.</p>
<p>Today is Sunday.</p>
<p>(all smiles).</p>
