> A leader shows patience by not running too far ahead of his followers and thus discouraging them.  While keeping ahead, he stays near enough for them to keep him in sight and hear his call forward. (J. Oswald Sanders)

Ten years have past since I first read this quote. It still continues to encourage me today.
