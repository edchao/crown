<p>I found it funny that in one of the Chinese apps it asks :</p>
<p>你會不會看中國字？ ___會 ＿＿＿不會</p>
<p><em>(translates to: can you read chinese? ___yes ____no) </em></p>
<p>I will also be applying to <a href="http://www.artcenter.edu/" title="Art Center Pasadena">Pasadena Art Center</a>.  My youth pastor went there for school, weird huh.  Does that mean I will one day be a youth pastor in a high class bay area suburbia? boy, what's next.  I wonder where he met his wife.</p>
