> 10 For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven,
And do not return there without watering the earth
And making it bear and sprout,
And furnishing seed to the sower and bread to the eater;
11 So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth;
It will not return to Me empty,
Without accomplishing what I desire,
And without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it.

As a shepherd of God’s flock, it’s sometimes disheartening to find out people you care for don’t love God’s Word as much as you want them to or imagine them to. This is when the shepherd himself must turn to the Word and find assurance from the Holy One of Israel. His ways and thoughts are greater (Is 55:8-9) than any pastor’s teaching or wisdom; He says He will never break His promise with David (Is 55:3); and He says His Word will not return to Him empty. That truth is a spiritual guidepost for any teacher of God’s Word.
