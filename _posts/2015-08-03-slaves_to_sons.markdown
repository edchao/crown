> In the same way we also, when we were children, were enslaved to the elementary principles of the world. But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!” So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God." (Galatians 4:3-7 ESV)

Read this in my devotions today. Amazing to reflect on how we have been changed FROM slaves to sin TO sons of God. What a contrast. Especially poignant since I currently house a slave to sin in my household, and the lessons it teaches my own heart as we deal with the ramifications of that. The sheer irrationality sin causes, the disregard for consequences, the callousness to how it offends God, all done with chilling ease. Would I never, would we never, grow so cold and accustomed to sin in our hearts. Rather, would we day after day cultivate a heart that cries “Abba! Father!” and runs to the Word, communes with our Savior, and submits to the Spirit.
