> Unite my heart to fear Your name. I will give thanks to You, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and will glorify Your name forever.

God my heart is often fragmented by anxieties borne from the fear of men or the fear of circumstance. Unite these pieces of my heart into a singular fear of your Name. My desire is that my whole heart should together give thanks to you and glorify You forever.
