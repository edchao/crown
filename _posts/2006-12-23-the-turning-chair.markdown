<p>the faint hum of the air conditioner makes the silence cold in more than one way</p>
<p>I sit in the chair, full of thoughts, and melodies of songs unsung.</p>
<p>A pathetic hero don't you agree?</p>
<p>a boy, yes still a boy but sometimes he blinks and sees the world as a man.</p>
<p>and when he doesn't blink again, his eyes water, they hurt, he must blink again</p>
<p>and once more, he is a boy, sitting in the turning chair, in the cold silence</p>
<p>thinking and singing in his head.</p>
