> O my God, I cry by day, but You do not answer; And by night, but I have no rest. Yet You are holy. (Psalm 22)

When prayers go unanswered, when trouble comes and there is no relief, let me bow down before the holiness of God. In the midst of injustice, and in the depths of suffering, His sovereign character is not in the least compromised.  It is this God that "lays me in the dust of death." And this God who "delivers my soul." Therefore, I will regard this God as holy and I will trust in Him.
