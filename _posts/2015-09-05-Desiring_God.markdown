> I think we delight to praise what we enjoy because the praise not merely expresses but completes the enjoyment; it is its appointed consumation.
(CS Lewis, Reflections on the Psalms, 1958, pp94-5)

Good ole' Clive Staples and his insights. I'm thankful to be reading Desiring God again. I had always promised myself that I'd re-read it every year, but it's been about two since I last read it. And I've sure forgotten a lot of the excellent reminders and truths contained in this treasured volume. 

It's quite fitting to the theme of this blog when you think about it. It's here for us to remind one another to keep striving after Christ, lest we flag in our desires for Him. So here's a toast to the classic volume which was so very seminal for all of us. May the Scriptures referenced and exposited re-kindle many of my own attenuated desires for God, who is the strength of my heart and portion forever. May I indeed praise Him every day because that praise is rising out of the consumation of my enjoyment.
