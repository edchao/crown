<div>A lot of people have asked me why I believe in God (and by implication why I am a Christian.)  I have composited a list here of a number of reasons that often come to mind. It is not a comprehensive list but it is one that I do often mentally reference.  The order of this list goes from most rational to most extra-rational (not irrational, I do not believe I am rejecting rationality in any of these).</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>It is the simplest explanation which answers the most issues with the least difficulty.</li>
<li>The Cosmological Argument seems more likely than the Uncaused argument</li>
<li>The Teleological Argument seems more likely than Evolution for various reasons (lack of transition species, power of genetic selection over genetic mutation, weakness of mutation to effect immediately advantageous change, etc)</li>
<li>The self-destructive idiocy and increasing individualistic egoism of man does not make sense if survival of species is his greatest aim.  However it does make sense if he is self-destructive by nature, which is irrational unless explained by the simple spiritual teaching of sin (or some complex argumentative gymnastics concerning cyclical evolution).</li>
<li>Atheists are 90% of the time, self important douche-bags</li>
<li>The intelligence, kindness, and general character of Christianity's most Biblical followers compels me to follow them rather than other religious or non-religious groups.</li>
<li>Historical Miracles recognized by conflicting nations, groups, or peoples, such as Israel and Egypt, Israel and Babylon, Rome and the Church, Suetonius, Josephus, etc.</li>
<li>The existence of prophecy (The reunification of National Israel, the downfall of ancient nations, the rise of nations like Persia, or Rome, Messianic prophecy, etc)</li>
<li>By implication of 8 and 9, the voracity and harmony of the Torah and the Christian Bible.</li>
<li>C.S Lewis once wrote that Jesus was either the Son of God, a deceiver, or a raving lunatic.  Personally, I find it most reasonable that He was the Son of God. And by implication there is a God.</li>
<li>Behavioral Consistency and Natural Disposition (I naturally will believe in God. Even if I aim not to, or mentally reject His existence, I will still end up living in consistency with that belief. And so does everyone else. I have yet to meet a consistent Atheist)</li>
<li>The universal search for, and experience of a Significance.  Everyone I have ever known has searched for, or desired after something that gave them significance.  But significance is a strange concept without the existence of the immaterial realm wherein such things boldly exist.  How come physically feeling good just isn't the same as attaining honor or glory? or physically feeling attraction is just not the same as feeling love?</li>
<li>The enjoyment of external majesty.  Why do we love to stand in front of huge things? Why do we feel awed by anything that is bigger than us (physical and conceptual)? I can only conclude that there is either some unknown evolutionary advantage to feeling this way, or because we were intended to desire and be with someone or something truly Great.</li>
<li>The existence of Self Sacrifice (by great people).  Why is it that only the great and most upright people are the most willing to sacrifice themselves for others? And the idiotic are the least to do so?  If I were going to program a species to progress and preserve itself, I would have the stupid ones want to sacrifice themselves first.</li>
<li>Unfulfilled Longing.  If there is a desire in me that cannot be fulfilled by anything in this world, I can only conclude that I was not made for this world.</li>
<li>Guilt and Morality.  I perceive the existence of moral law, both in my individual dispositions, as well as on a global scale.  Morality may exist differently in different places, but it always exists.  Morality is bound up with the idea of God, because it requires One to whom your actions are either offensive or pleasing. When I transgress a moral tenet, I always feel guilty.  (In fact I felt guilty as a child before I knew what I was doing wrong. ) That guilt is the most real feeling I have ever felt and I cannot write it away as societal nurture.</li>
<li>Spiritual Experience / Personal Witness.  I have experienced many and varied things that solidify my beliefs on God and Christianity.  This involves intense personal change, inexplainable encounters with spiritual realities, feeling depths of joy previously unknown, the growth and enlivening of the intellect, the sudden delight and ability to comprehend and apply Scripture, the ability to feel peace in the midst of certain trial, the ever-increasing crystallization of a cohesive world view and individual purpose, etc.</li>
<li>Internal Coercion.  At the end of the day, I do not think I can not believe in Christianity.  Sometimes I think it was never in my power to reject it.</li>
