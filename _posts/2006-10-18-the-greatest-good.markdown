<p>One of the thoughts that has been running through my head over and over again these past few months is the depth of good I have in God apart from all else.  It is of course, as most biblical assurances are, easy to say but difficult to believe.</p>
<p>If all my greatest career-related dreams came true and I had all the money I ever wanted, at last becoming the great man of success that my dad always wanted me to be, and then was suddenly robbed of all I had and spent the rest of my life on the streets, would I still consider myself wealthy because of my imperishable inheritance in the Lord?</p>
<p>I love my family deeply.  I have thousands of memories with them that make me smile and laugh and feel warm inside.  How about if I had to choose between having God or having my mom, dad and my dear brother Jon?  would I choose God?  Would I choose him begrudgingly?  Or would I consider myself richly blessed even without my family, as long as I had Him?</p>
<p>What about if I married the love of my life and after exchanging vows, with the strong and joyful realization that I was going to spend the rest of my life together with her, watched as she suddenly collapsed and died, would I consider myself to be more than fulfilled because even without her, God is mine and I am His?</p>
<p>I ask myself these questions, and I keep trying to evaluate whether the Lord is really more than enough for me.  Do I really see Him as overabundant? Do I really perceive my cup to be overflowing?  These are tough questions to ask for me, and even tougher to affirm.  I realize again and again, as I so often do during times of trial, that counting everything as loss is hard.  Whatever it is I consider precious, God is able to take away.  But if He does it, it is so that I might understand what it means for the Lord to be "the strength of my heart, and my portion forever."  And when I understand it rightly, I think it will be worth the loss because I will have finally gained Him truly.</p>
<blockquote><p>"O Lord, if this were lost instead,<br />
And all I had was you, I would<br />
Be rich, and have the greatest Good."</p>
<p>-excerpt from "The Misery of Job and the Mercy of God" by John Piper</p></blockquote>
