<p>Lead us, Evolution, lead us<br />
Up the future's endless stair:<br />
Chop us, change us, prod us, weed us,<br />
For stagnation is despair:<br />
Groping, guessing, yet progressing,<br />
Lead us nobody knows where.</p>
<p>Wrong or justice in the present,<br />
Joy or sorrow, what are they<br />
While there's always jam to-morrow,<br />
While we tread the onward way?<br />
Never knowing where we're going,<br />
We can never go astray.</p>
<p>To whatever variation<br />
Our posterity may turn<br />
Hairy, squashy, or crustacean,<br />
Bulbous-eyed or square of stern,<br />
Tusked or toothless, mild or ruthless,<br />
Towards that unknown god we yearn.</p>
<p>Ask not if it's god or devil,<br />
Brethren, lest your words imply<br />
Static norms of good and evil<br />
(As in Plato) throned on high;<br />
Such scholastic, inelastic,<br />
Abstract yardsticks we deny.</p>
<p>Far too long have sages vainly<br />
Glossed great Nature's simple text;<br />
He who runs can read it plainly,<br />
'Goodness = what comes next.'<br />
By evolving, Life is solving<br />
Ail the questions we perplexed.</p>
<p>On then! Value means survival -<br />
Value. If our progeny<br />
Spreads and spawns and licks each rival,<br />
That will prove its deity.<br />
(Far from pleasant, by our present<br />
Standards, though it well may be.)</p>
