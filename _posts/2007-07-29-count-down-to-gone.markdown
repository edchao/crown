<p>There's less than one week left for me here in L.A.   Saturday morning while the sun is still rising I'm scheduled to drive up north to spend a couple weeks with my folks before  I hop onto a plane for Taipei and the city life.</p>
<p>So if you are still around and have some spare time on your hands, I'd be deeply touched by even the briefest of tootles and a cheesy smile to remember you by.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone for a life changing four years.  Your absences will be felt deeply.</p>
<p>May the Lord Return before we meet again.</p>
