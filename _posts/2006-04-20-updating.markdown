<p>Yes I know I haven't posted in awhile.  That is because this quarter I have to get up at 7:30 everyday so I can't be up and about at the most ridiculous hours, hence, no talking crazy.  Furthermore, I haven't had anything really to say that would be helpful, useful, or poignant.  Well, be patient, one of these nights, the craziness will come.</p>
