<p>Who doesn't like the Matrix? Come now, lets be honest. Flying bullets stopping in mid air, punching so fast your fist looks like a thousand blurs, dodging bullets fired from fully automatic machine guns ...we all wish we could either move that fast or make time feel that slow.</p>
<p>When I first thought of the Timelessness of God, meaning that God is not contained by the constraints of Time, I thought of it like God holding a film strip between two fingers.  The film strip is the complete timeline of our current reality.  And as he holds that film strip he sees both the end and the beginning in one glance.  In that sense he stands outside of time and can observe it completely.  (This does not however nullify His ability to affect time or the series of events of which it may consist.)</p>
<p>I haven't changed my mind about that but I have thought about it more.  You see, that illustration is okay when it comes to describing the abstract concept of Timelessness and grounding it in something understandeable. However, it makes God seem distant, impersonable, and relationally uninvolved with individuals.  That's not right, because God is deeply involved with individuals.  So I've thought of a better way to think about the Timelessness of God which preserves His intimacy with His creation.</p>
<p>So, back to the Matrix idea.  One of the powers I've always wanted was the ability to slow down time leading to the super rad ability to dodge bullets or punch really fast.  What that really means though is that in some way or another, I would like the ability to perceive and experience my own time independent of the Time the world experiences.  So if I slowed down everything down, that would mean I could be walking around normally while everyone was frozen still.  I could stand in front of a random person and observe him as he slowly blinks, perhaps taking a full hour before his eyes are finally shut.</p>
<p>Now back to God.  First let me say that God is able to do far more than what I have just mentioned.  This little scene about slowing down time is just a human idea which takes into consideration human limits and perceptions.  God is wholly different in his transcendence and greater abilities.  But, let's stick with the idea anyways.  If God were able to do this, and He can, He could experience every second of our lives like they lasted a thousand years.  I mean, would it not be possible that even in this moment before I type the next letter God has already spent a week just standing next to me watching my fingers slowly descend to hit the key?  The point is this, if God is timeless, He is far more intimate with us than we can imagine.</p>
<p>Now I know that may be a lot to swallow.  And I admit I've already bit off more than I can chew.  But it's a thought that I keep thinking about not only because it is mentally astonishing but also because the thought of someone spending more time with me than I could ever spend with them makes me feel very loved,  to the point of being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>I am certain that all of us have experienced sorrowful times in our lives when we have felt either ignored, abandoned or very alone. I think we would agree that those are the times we want to feel the intimacy of our God the most.  Now let this thought sink in.  Perhaps, in those moments when we are hurting the most, God spends them with us for a thousand years.</p>
<p>Just a thought.</p>
