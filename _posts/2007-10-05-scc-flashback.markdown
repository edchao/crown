<blockquote><p>I have come to this ocean, and the waves of fear are starting to grow.  Doubts and questions are rising with the tide, so I'm clinging to the one true thing I know.  And I've tried to hold many treasures, but they keep slipping through my fingers like sand.  There's one treasure that means more than life itself, so I'm clinging on with everything I am.  Like a child holding on to a promise, I will cling to His word and believe.  As I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me,</p>
<p>I will hold on to the hand of my Savior, I will hold on with all my might.  I will hold loosely to things that are fleeting and hold on to Jesus, I'll hold on to Jesus for life.</p>
