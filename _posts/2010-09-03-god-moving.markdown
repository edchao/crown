<p>I was recently asked whether I've seen God moving in my life recently.  I think it's a great question to ask yourself every once in awhile just as a good reality check for your spiritual life.  Some things I've realized from thinking about the question:</p>
<ol>
<li>The greatest way God moves is winning people to Christ.  The pinnacle of the scriptures is God's glory displayed through His redemptive grace.</li>
<li>The second greatest way God moves is in conquering sin in my own life. Conquering Sin &gt; Conquering sickness etc.</li>
<li>God moves in the overall unfolding of your daily life, to lead you to where He wants you to be in order to form you into who He wants you to be. It's like everyone gets to live a joseph story of their own, but we don't realize we're joseph unless we walk by faith.</li>
<li>All things mundane are upheld by the hand of God. there is nothing that is outside of the causality of God.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fin.</p>
