In the past few months the Lord has been making me a student of Magnanimity. From the latin Magna (Great) Animus (Mind/Soul). Which in turn is from the greek μεγάλος (Great) and ψυχή (Soul).   It describes a great soul. One that refuses to be petty. It is the man with a capacity for only the worthy things who swiftly skips over the inconsequential. This is a quality best displayed by our Lord. He was not injured by the critic, nor did he squabble over rights or riches. He cared only for that which was of value.
