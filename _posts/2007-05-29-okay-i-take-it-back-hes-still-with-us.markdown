<p>For awhile I was afraid the respected Dr. John Piper was becoming emergent in his theology and practice.  But after listening to this sermon, I take it back.   He has <em>not</em> given over to cultural embrace to the degree that his sensitivity to spiritual realities has been blunted.  <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/Blog/649_hell_and_netflix/" title="John Piper ">This message</a> is deeply convicting for me, listen at your own risk.</p>
