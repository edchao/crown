<p>so much of life is spent waiting.  We wait for the shower, we wait for the sink, we wait for the kitchen, we wait in our rooms, we wait by the door, we wait in the elevator, we wait on the curb, we wait in the car, we wait for the next IM, we wait for the next email, we wait for the call, we wait for food to heat up, we wait at the checkout, we wait to get our diplomas, we wait to get our job offers, we wait for that special someone to show up, we wait for our parents to finish what they're doing, we wait for our siblings to pick us up, we wait for the year to pass and another to begin, we wait for our troubles to blow over, we wait and we wait.  And yet for all that waiting, we enjoy so little of what we wait for.</p>
<p>I don't if that's a tragedy or just a lesson behind a veil.  I sometimes wonder why God wrote our lives that way.</p>
