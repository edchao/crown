<p>my teacher is a follower of dear Confucius.  I got to talk to him about morals, relative morality, self-principles, and wisdom today on the way home from the hot spring (that's right friends, I went to the hot springs with my teacher! eat that Beland) There's still some way to go before we can start getting into absolute truth vs. moral relativism.  I need to go read up on Zen too...boo.</p>
<p>Oh, and he agreed to keep hitting the onsens up next school quarter with me.  Seems like the start of a legitimate friendship.</p>
<p>Lesson: Look out for number two</p>
