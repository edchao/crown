<p>I've realized that it doesn't matter how good your voice is.  As long as you know it's yours, you don't like it.  Last night I was listening to some random song for a brief moment, and for a split second I thought it was me singing.  I didn't like it, sounded lame.  Turns out it was jason mraz.  The moment that realization occurred, I liked it.  Weird</p>
<p>There's a different rule, albeit related, considering the knowledge of whether or not the voice belongs to an Asian or not.  For some reason, knowing it's an Asian singing kills the quality.  For example I used to think Amos Lee was asian (wouldn't you?)  I listened to a couple songs and didn't like it, "Asian-voice," I thought, "lame". But then I looked him up, and turns out he's black.  Suddenly I think his voice is great.</p>
<p>Now I'm thinking, "what's wrong with my brain?" ugh.</p>
