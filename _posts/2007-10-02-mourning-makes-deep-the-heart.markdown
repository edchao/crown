<p>In  a Sermon John MacArthur delivered on September 29 of this year at the DGM Stand conference he said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"I remember when my son had a brain tumor.  I remember when my wife had a car accident...The agony of those days and hours as she, by the grace of God and his providential care, survived that.  But I buried her many times every day as I had buried my son many times every day before that was resolved..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I listen to things like this, I begin to understand that mourning makes the heart deeper.  Solomon's words carry much of the same message:</p>
<blockquote><p>“  It is better to go to a house of mourning<br />
Than to go to a house of feasting,<br />
Because that is the end of every man,<br />
And the living takes it to heart.<br />
Sorrow is better than laughter,<br />
For when a face is sad a heart may be happy.<br />
The mind of the wise is in the house of mourning,<br />
While the mind of fools is in the house of pleasure.”<br />
(Eccl 7:2-4 NAS95S)</p></blockquote>
