<p>Sometimes life can become fairly romantic.  When I say romantic here I don't mean flowers and poems or candle-lit dinners.  Think, epic and larger than life, heightened emotions, the awareness of a publicly silent but personally audible soundtrack.   Okay, I'll admit it first upfront as a disclaimer, this sort of thinking is not always bad really, and I would say it could even be good if it gives us a better view of a greater reality (namely, that of the coming Kingdom and its many glories).  But usually the romanticized version of our lives gets us either delusional or depressed.  It's not real of course.  If you just stand still for a moment you will realize that there is no music, that the story unraveling through time is not about you,  that you are not in the center of a thousand dollar cinematic shot, and that there are very few people who care at that point about who you are and what you're doing.  That's not my remedy, but I think it's funny.</p>
<p>Here's how I deal with the romanticized view of life.  At the end of my day, when the movie which is my life draws to its glorious conclusion, I open a big fat tome on Theology Proper, set it on the table and start reading about God.  Let me tell you, that will snap a drifting mind to attention pretty quickly.  You see, when you're taking a good hard look at the Almighty Sovereign, all the shallow cinematic dreaming gets stripped away and things suddenly get very, very real.  I love that.  Again and again I keep becoming more convinced that God is no figment of the imagination.  Because in fact, the sheer potency of His reality, when apprehended correctly, is able to snatch the sentimental wool from our eyes.  He is so real, that we cannot be fake when we are with Him.  The presence of God is is a place of penetrating honesty.  When we are in it, we see ourselves as we are.</p>
