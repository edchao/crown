<p>These are the sort of times when I look up to the sky and say, "God. why would you do this to me?"</p>
<p>and even though I don't hear any audible responses. I get the feeling the answer is: "Because you are an idiot."</p>
<p>well, at least I still have my phone, my keys, my computer and my passport.</p>
<p>sigh.</p>
