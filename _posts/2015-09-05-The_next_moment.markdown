> The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God,” They are corrupt, and have committed abominable injustice; There is no one who does good. God has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men To see if there is anyone who understands, Who seeks after God. (Psalm 53:1-2)

Atheism is a declaration to oneself, not an observation of truth. But it is shown here to be foolishness, because God appears in the next verse.  Likewise, as the atheist today declares God’s absence, the next moment is already occupied by God.
