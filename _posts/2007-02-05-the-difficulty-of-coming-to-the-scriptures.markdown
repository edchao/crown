<p>It's been about four years now since I learned to study the Scriptures and to go deep with the Word.  A year and a half of learning to teach it and develop it into something understandable.  And near 8 years of being a Christian in possession of a Holy Bible.  That's almost a third of my life living with the Word of the Lord.  And yet, the Scriptures are still, yes even today, hard to open when I'm alone.  I don't intend to answer the question why it's hard because the cause is obvious.  My sin.</p>
<p>Now, the specific sin that is most threatening to me today is not lust, discontentment, or even pride. The great and silent killer sin is Laziness.  Can you believe it? But did you know, men have died because they lacked discipline?</p>
<blockquote><p>  “The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him, and he is held fast in the cords of his sin.  He dies for lack of discipline, and because of his great folly he is led astray.” (Prov 5:22-23 ESV)</p></blockquote>
<p>Failure to keep attentive to the truth and  soberminded concerning their surroundings is a guarantee for making a shipwreck of faith.   Don't commit spiritual suicide just because your lazy.  Its like kicking your own stool away and hanging yourself because you're tired of standing.  It's just not worth it to be lazy.</p>
