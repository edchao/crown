<p>I went to my first basketball game last night against LongBeach State.  It turned out to be crazier than a football game.  Who knew? Even though I didn't get my hand stamped or get the special priority seating slip, I was able to get into the student section on the floor, thanks to a friendly ticket taker.  When people yelled, the players could actually hear us. It was great, one of the guys sitting behind me yelled "Hey #2, give up on life!" and #2 actually turned around and frowned.</p>
<p>You know, I realized there are a lot of places I haven't been.  I was standing in line at the CTO with my friend Tim from AA, and he started naming off places I've never been like Disneyland, Magic Mountain, Six flags, etc.  I think he said I was an alien.  Funny, I thought I was cultured.</p>
