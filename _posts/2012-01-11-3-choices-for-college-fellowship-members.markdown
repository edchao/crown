<p>Today I read Matt 13 in my devotional. I've read this verse many times before but today it was a powerful and sobering lesson. In the past this verse has always been an abstract statement. Yes, there will be those who hear and show growth only to reveal in time that their hearts were hard and the word did not penetrate. Agreed, there will also be those who because of their love for the world find their desire for Christ choked out by it. And finally those who bloom, will bloom indeed, living lives full of fruit and faith.</p>
<p>But today I look at my life and the lives of so many of my old fellowship friends. The word of God is true. Painfully so. What was once abstract is now glaringly real. Those who once showed so much promise have now fallen away because their exuberance for Christ was never real. Those who struggled with having one foot in the world and one foot in the Lord have found that they never had stepped into the Lord at all. And finally those who believed and loved deeply, still believe and love deeply today.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters there are only 3 choices. I can only ask myself the same question, will I turn out to be false, worldly, or truly in love with the Son of God?</p>
