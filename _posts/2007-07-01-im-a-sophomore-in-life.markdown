<p>People tell me I'm getting old.  I don't really think I'm that old, but I suppose I can see where they're coming from.  School is over, real life is beginning.  The fun is over, responsibility begins.</p>
<p>But I like to think about it this way.  Just before you get to serious about this, let me just say that it's not biblical, it's just interesting.  If the Bible says life runs about 80 years, then I'm in my sophomore year of life.  1-20 is freshman, 21-40 is sophomore, 41-60 is Junior, and 61-80 is the wise senior.</p>
<p>It sort of does correspond if you think of it.  When you were a freshman, either in highschool or in college life was just playtime.  You got taken care of.  Likewise in your teenage years, you're taken care of by your folks (especially if your Asian).  It's not until your sophomore year (21-40) that you begin taking things seriously. Life is no longer fun and games and late night silliness but you actually have to start taking care of business.  And just like a sophomore, you start to think you know things, but really you don't. (That's me, I think I know things, but I don't... I don't know squat.  There is still a bajillion things that are off the charts.)</p>
<p>I was talking to my buddy Jaeson Ma, the other day and I agree with him.  Life is just beginning for us.</p>
