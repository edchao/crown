<p>the call is the same. Repent and return to Jesus. There's nothing in the scriptures that tells you you need to first start feeling like junk before you can come to God.  It is enough that you recognize your sin as sin and come to Jesus, willing to forsake it all for Him.</p>
<p>Contrition is not always emotional at first.  It is first of all, an intellectual assent which brings an emotional response.  But the emotional response  may take awhile to set in. What's the point of saying this? I just want to clarify one thing: Don't ever let your emotions tell you when or when you cannot come to God.</p>
<p>The father would have received his prodigal son whether or not he came weeping just as long as he came.</p>
<p>So if you're out there, waiting to feel ashamed.  Don't wait any longer. Just come.</p>
