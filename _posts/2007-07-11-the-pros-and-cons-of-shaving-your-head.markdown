<p>That's right folks, I shaved that sucker.  I haven't done it since Freshman year, and figured, why not, better time than any! Nobody's looking, and I'm not caring, why not go for it.  And look, honestly, it'll grow back in a week or two.  So, now that It's done.  Here are the pro's and con's:</p>
<p>THE PRO'S</p>
<ol>
<li>You get to know the real shape of your head, the mystery is unveiled!</li>
<li>All of a sudden you feel more gangster when you're running or working out</li>
<li>There is an inexplicable delight when the shower water just streams off your head, feels incredible.</li>
<li>You never have to worry about shampoo, gel, drying off, or bad hair days.  Makes life simpler</li>
<li>You get a taste of what it feels like do deal with balding, kind of like a free trial you can always exchange after 2 weeks.</li>
<li>You get to find out if you can live with being bald (yes! I believe I can!)</li>
<li>Hats are no longer just accesories but special lids hiding wonderful surprises</li>
<li>You can live out your childhood dreams of being a shaolin monk in the privacy of your own apartment.</li>
<li>lice and fleas can no longer survive on your scalp.</li>
<li>Wearing a beater no longer looks as pathetic...</li>
<li>It is yet another way to cool yourself off during those hot summer nights.</li>
<li>You get to look a little more like Alan Cheung, and that's every man's dream.</li>
</ol>
<p>THE CONS</p>
<ol>
<li>People think you're ugly, or have gotten uglier</li>
<li>People keep asking you about your head, and you get tired of explaining yourself</li>
<li>Usually the surprise people get when you remove your cap quickly turns into horror or running away</li>
<li>If you really are balding, you just lost all your hair to a whim, sucka-foo</li>
<li>If your head is weird or alien like, you've got to live with it in plain view for a couple weeks before it gets to hide again.</li>
<li>Patches due to uneven shaving can make you look like you're malnourished.</li>
</ol>
<p>But hey that's not so bad.  6 cons vs. 12 Pro's? Clearly the good outweighs the bad.  here are a few glamour shots for the curious, i.e. the strong of stomach.</p>
