<p>It is very different.  Expectations in some ways are greater and in other ways are lower.  Musically, people don't care as much how skilled you are or how well the instruments come together, in that sense expectations are lower. However appearance and conduct are much more important than you could ever imagine.  You may play the most epic song of praise ever, but if you dress shabby or are perceived to be conducting yourself too casually, then you'll hear about it. It's scary stuff!  </p>
<p>So, still deciding if I want to be regular in leading music on Sundays.</p>
<p>In other news, I'm learning about using anonymous functions in javascript/jquery.  </p>
