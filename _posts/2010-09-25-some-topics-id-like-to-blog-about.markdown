<p>There are some topics that have been on my mind lately that I think I will write about in the future. Here's a preview list.</p>
<p>1. Sanctification and Identity<br />
2. Reactionism and post college life<br />
3. Tempted yet without Sin, Christ vs Adam<br />
4. The persona elaborated in community</p>
