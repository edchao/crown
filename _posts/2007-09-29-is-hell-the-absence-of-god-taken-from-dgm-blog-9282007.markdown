<p>"R.C. Sproul gives a masterful response to this common explanation:</p>
<blockquote><p> 	It is common to say that hell is 	the absence of God. Such statements are motivated in large part by the dread of 	even contemplating what hell is like. We try often to soften that blow and find 	a euphimism to skirt  around it.</p>
<p>We need to realize that those who 	are in hell desire nothing more than the absence of God. They didn’t want to be 	in God’s presence during their earthly lives, and they certainly don’t want Him 	near when they’re in hell. The worst thing about hell is the presence of God 	there.</p>
<p>When we use the imagery of the Old 	Testament in an attempt to understand the forsakenness of the lost, we are not 	speaking of the idea of the departure of God or the absence of God in the sense 	that He ceases to be omnipresent. Rather, it’s a way of describing the 	withdrawal of God in terms of His redemptive blessing. It is the absence of the 	light of His countenance. It is the presence of the frown of His countenance. 	It is the absence of the blessedness of His unveiled glory that is a delight to 	the souls of those who love Him, but it is the presence of the darkness of 	judgment. Hell reflects the presence of God in His mode of judgment, in His 	exercise of wrath, and that’s what everyone would like to escape.</p>
<p>I think that’s why we get confused. 	There is withdrawal in terms of the blessing of the radical nearness of God. 	His benefits can be removed far from us, and that’s what this language is 	calling attention to.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Side note: hearing brother Leo's  testimony (a Taiwanese brother who studies 3 hrs of the word everyday)and watching Matt Hauck (pastor at EBCT) study greek has inspired me to start translating again. Today I begin Galatians.  The first verse, is the easiest "Paul, an apostle not from men nor through a man but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, the one who awakened him (Christ) from the dead..."</em></p>
