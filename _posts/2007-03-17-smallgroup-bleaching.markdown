<p>but it wasn't right. Turned out it wasn't real hair bleach, just some extra-lightner thing.  So we tried again the next day.  This time it was real bleach.  Here's me being a leader.</p>

<p>The bleaching went on for awhile, almost everyone had a go.  We even gave Will another try.  (didn't turn out so hot though. my bad.)</p>

<p>that's chris I think.  See Nate holding the foil, he wanted highlights, we told him it was fruity.  He relented.</p>
