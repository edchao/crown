> But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. 6 For some men, straying from these things, have turned aside to fruitless discussion, wanting to be teachers of the Law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions. (1 Timothy  1:5-7)

A discussion bears no fruit if it is motivated by ego, engaged without understanding, and struck with unfounded confidence. 

What does bear fruit? Generating love towards others from the wellsprings of purity, good conscience, and sincere faith.
