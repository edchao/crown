<p>With his head bent down his eyes<br />
Were locked upon the screen, Despite<br />
The hour, far too late for most.<br />
As a guard might keep his post<br />
With bright eyes, and attentive mind<br />
He was alert, and felt a kind<br />
Of unmistakable unrest.<br />
The study of the word, the chest<br />
Of treasures giv’n by the Lord<br />
Was all this young man hungered for.</p>
<p>A single lamp with golden light<br />
Shed just enough for human sight<br />
To recognize the forms of words<br />
And in the silence, he whispered<br />
Them to himself.  So deep<br />
And meaningful.  He’d reap<br />
As much as he could of this truth.<br />
Wisdom is not barred from youth,<br />
Was what he thought when he first turned<br />
His quiet times to lessons learned.</p>
<p>The last four years were years of change<br />
Both great and small.  Great in that stage<br />
Where faith is stripped of all pretense<br />
And discipleship is made intense<br />
By reconstructing frames of life<br />
From pagan forms to forms of Christ.<br />
And also small in that one sense<br />
where things, mundane, are reassessed<br />
to realign to Scriptures scale<br />
or be discarded if they fail.</p>
<p>The years that passed were not without<br />
Its share of griefs and tears.  About<br />
Two years ago he walked a road<br />
That he believed was all he’d know<br />
For all the years to come.  Who knew<br />
That God would break his heart.  And through<br />
The brokeness show him his hope<br />
Had gone beyond the holy scope<br />
Of Jesus Christ.  No other stone<br />
Could be his base. He stands alone.<br />
The Holy Son, amidst the shards<br />
Of dreams once gods, now dust.</p>
<p>Apart<br />
From all the pain he felt,<br />
He knew that still his soul was well.<br />
And from that sad and desperate stand.<br />
He made his peace with God’s great hand<br />
Of love and wisdom.  There he stood<br />
Before the seat of Sovereign good.<br />
And from that point theology<br />
Became far more than knowledge.  He<br />
Saw how the truth could truly be<br />
So deep in its reality.<br />
That he should make his sole delight<br />
The Lord was simple in his mind<br />
But when it came to crushing blows<br />
Where treasures of his heart were thrown<br />
Into the purifying fire<br />
Of God’s decree.  His true desire<br />
was there laid bare, a clear display<br />
by means of God’s relentless Grace.</p>
<p>Now sitting there he read the Word<br />
While not a single sound was heard<br />
above the turning pages and<br />
The tapping of his fingers. Hand<br />
Upon his chin his mind was full<br />
Of thoughts and hopes, the pull<br />
Of heaven and of holy dreams<br />
Filling him with living streams.<br />
And in the quiet of his room,<br />
While thousands slept, as though in tombs.<br />
This man walked in truth, set free<br />
From every bond, captivity<br />
Was in the past. Because<br />
Of Jesus cross. He was<br />
Delivered now From death and hell<br />
And hopeless striving’s cursed spell,<br />
And also from the fear of loss<br />
And sorrow from the fullest cost<br />
Of giving all to gain but Him<br />
By finding there, Joy infinite.</p>
<p>The highest love and brightest light<br />
Has shone upon the weary plight<br />
Of grieving Christians everywhere.<br />
God yet has gracious good to spare<br />
For his dear children.  I am one.<br />
Every battle has been won.<br />
Yes, Fighting now, though sitting still.<br />
By letting Truth, from His word spill<br />
Upon the anxious thoughts and fears<br />
And overwhelming sorrows tears<br />
by pouring joy through blissful hope<br />
That while in darkness now I grope<br />
For answers I will one day touch<br />
The face of God, it is too much<br />
For me to dream yes, even now<br />
When I have yet to die.  The crown<br />
Of righteousness is mine<br />
If I refuse to here repine<br />
Before my time on earth is gone.<br />
God be my strength and grace beyond<br />
my wildest dreams. my confidence<br />
in Scripture gives my soul a sense<br />
of greater truths and greater bliss<br />
For One alone do I exist.<br />
All life and joy are in your Word.<br />
I have believed, and I have heard.</p>
