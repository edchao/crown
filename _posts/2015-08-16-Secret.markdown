> your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you. (Matt 6:3)

Be the hidden hand of God's kindness and not the showy hand of an egotist. Keep your service secret. For why should you exchange an eternal reward for temporal recognition? Be careful not to praise even yourself. For that is not only foolish but deadly.
