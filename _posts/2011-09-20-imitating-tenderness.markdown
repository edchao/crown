<p>We all once slept in the streets of alienation with only our shame to clothe us.  And yet, beyond all hope we have found a warm and loving Home with Jesus, the most noble of masters.  By his pierced hand He has adopted us into his family and loves us forevermore.  What unspeakable tenderness!</p>
<p>I am growing in appreciating this truth.  And it is growing in me tenderness.</p>
