<p>People who know me well know that I'm crazy about fantasy fiction.  I'm a fantasy-fanatic.  I actually set aside time at the end of my day to read it.  I treat it like dessert.  That's how much I love it.  But tonight, for some strange reason, I'd much rather sit at my desk and study Paul's letter to the Galatians than read the epic fantasy novel, The Hobbit.</p>
<p>That's a lot crazier than you think.</p>
