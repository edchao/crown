<p>Few seasons have the effect that October has on me.  It is the month of expectation.  It is the cork that pops from that delicious bottle called "The Holiday Season".  When the 1st of October breaks, you know what's coming: Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, and all the little mini-events in between.</p>
<p>And it's not just the celebratory stuff.  I love the subtle chill in the wind, the smell of the rain on the pavement, the wet leaves, the bundling up before going out, and the unbundling after coming in.  I love driving past rows of trees turning red and orange.  Because even though I know the leaves are dying, it feels like they are spending their last bit of energy on being vibrant and beautiful, and if I could, I'd tell them "mission complete leafy leaf."  I love pulling on plaid pj pants and reading kids fiction under warm blankets (it's Narnia tonight) or steeping a fresh batch of hot tea when I get in to work.  And oh I mustn't forget, starbucks pumpkin spice...or... frothy chai lattes, and then walking through the cold with it warming your hands.  Late night hangouts with coworkers or local buddies are the norm during October, and for some reason everyone gets friendly when the night is brisk and the rooms are toasty.  And for some reason, every thing just feels so meaningful, nostalgic, and romantic...you know what I mean?</p>
<p>But when all is said and done, the reason why I love October is because right here buzzing just under the surface, I'm still a kid who wants to believe that things really can be magical.  There's still a lot of wide-eyed wonder left in me. And what can I say, when October comes around, things really do start feeling magical (with a lower case m).  And can I say something more about that, about the whole thing about having a sense of wonder in my life.. I am so profoundly thankful that God hasn't taken that away from me. This world is severely bereft of wonder.  People are just so dull and emotionally dimwitted these days that I want to shoot myself. They can't feel what they're supposed to anymore, their hearts have atrophied into pitiful little polyps.  These people are what CS Lewis calls "Men without Chests."  That tragic crowd of self-professed intellectuals (which is pretty much everyone these days) who have so feared the effects of emotions upon their rational capacity that they have simply removed them from themselves.  And thus they are no longer capable of knowing when and how to feel what they ought.  Ugh! Rain is just rain to them.  Wind is just wind. Pumpkin spice, is sweet, but only on their tongue. And what's all this bundling up? How troublesome!</p>
<p>Truly stupid I say.  When did all these people die with their eyes open?</p>
<p><em>Oh October, how forlorn you must be that old hearts ignore you so.</em></p>
<p><em>When you, the deepest of months, are mistaken to be shallow by the shallow indeed.</em></p>
<p><em>And God, The Bottomless, is invisible.</em></p>
