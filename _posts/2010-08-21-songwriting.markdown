<p>I think I'm going to start trying at this songwriting thing again.   I've always wanted to spend a legit amount of time just doing this and enjoying what I come up with, but I've been putting it off forever, because I normally don't enjoy what I come up with.  but this time, I'm gonna roll with it, just for process' sake.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and I'm gonna try really hard not to come up with anything cliche.  good luck right?</p>
