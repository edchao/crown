<p>men of greatness do not come from lines of great descent<br />
nor are they alway born with greater qualities in them.<br />
And greatness is not measured by one's intellect or strength<br />
nor does popularity or influence or reign<br />
but kindness and humility and gentleness and truth<br />
and honesty when smiles are giv'n, true tenderness will prove<br />
the man who has the strength to care with gentleness is great<br />
who stands unmoved by winds of scorn and crowds who mock and hate.<br />
the man who cradles hearts and speaks the truth with gracious voice<br />
is greater than the man who starts a war by reckless choice.<br />
the man who puts his child to sleep and prays beside his bed,<br />
is greater than the richest man whose children he forgets,<br />
men of greatness are not always seen for who they are<br />
kindness often is mistaken for the weak of heart<br />
but greater strength has no man than the one who lives by grace<br />
and gives it openly with tenderness and kindly face.<br />
I think there is a need today for greatness in our men<br />
so many are so angry and so few dare to offend<br />
But where are all those men of grace whose lives speak of the King<br />
who did not care for dignity but took our shame to bring<br />
the truest life, the greatest good, the purest prize of all<br />
But I am foolish, angry, reckless, in all of these I fall.<br />
So help me God to not lose heart, and not give in to lies<br />
that serving me is greater far than any sacrifice.<br />
I admit I'm not a man of greatness, this I know<br />
it is my shame to say but I am not beyond the hope<br />
that someday when the storm returns my hand will stay the course<br />
and all the churning of my heart will not take me by force<br />
but impulse will be held by truth and anger held by love<br />
To know that Jesus died for me is yet again enough.</p>
