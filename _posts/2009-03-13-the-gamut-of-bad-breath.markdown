<p>Bad Breath is infamously terrible.  Anybody has been there, sitting in front of a teacher who drank too much coffee, or a friend who has just eaten a banana. You smile, but under that smile is a row of gritted teeth.  I'd like to talk about the types of bad breath that are out there, and possible solutions for them.  I know I would usually put this in my Tumblr blog, but since this will be a longer post, I might as well post here.  The following is a compilation of the top 12 bad breath types, in order of descending intensity.</p>
<p>1. Smoker's Breath</p>
<p>The worst of all bad breaths. Talking to a smoker is like coming face to face with a mutant's refuse.  It smells that bad.  It's a weird toxic, sensory dulling, odor, that a zombie might have if he ate a dead rat.  The only solution here is to stop smoking.  Sorry folks. Sucking on a stog really is bad for you and embarrassingly uncomfortable for your disgusted friends.</p>
<p>2. Barf Breath</p>
<p>A close second to Smoker's breath, this kind of breath is usually for the drunks or the bulimic.  No matter how many mints you eat, you can't hide the rancid smell of bile and rotting foodstuffs from your barfy tongue.  Solution! Stop barfing.  If you can't help it due to nausea, then try anti-nausea pills.  Another solution is to scrape your tongue, brush your teeth, and eat a burger, scrape again and then chew some gum.  You want your salivary glands to work for you.</p>
<p>3. Banana Breath</p>
<p>It smells like a banana, but humid, hot, sweet, and way gross.  Usually people have banana breath in the morning, when they eat one for breakfast.  This is not good, since your morning breath finds a way to merge with the banana breath creating a devastating wallop of an odor.  Save your bananas for later in the day, and do not eat them solo. Combine them with something and then wash it down with a drink.</p>
<p>4. Coffee Breath</p>
<p>The office is full of coffee breath.  It's the worst when you are talking to a higher upper and you need to smile the whole way through because otherwise you're fired.  It's a grossly intense smell, coffee-esque yes, but unlike coffee, it's very very sharp. It jams up into your sinuses and makes your eyes water if you have too much.  People who have coffee breath usually carry mints around, but sometimes not.  In this case, I recommend switching over to tea.</p>
<p>5. Garlic Breath</p>
<p>For some reason, this doesn't smell like garlic.  It smells like general stinkiness with a couple small sharp pinches to the sinus.  It's not sour, it's not sweet, it's not bitter, it's just heavy and overwhelming.  If large amounts of garlic are eaten, then this breath becomes Smoker breath's little brother.  Solution. only tongue scraping and mouthwash can make a dent in this.</p>
<p>6. Lamb Breath</p>
<p>Sick. Lamb already has a dark gamey flavor, usually brought out with garlic. Lamb breath is just the ugly flavor in lamb magnified through rotting in your mouth.  This is a personal peeve, so maybe I just need to get over it.  But hey, please have mercy and at least chew some gum afterwards.</p>
<p>7. Vinegar Breath</p>
<p>You get this after you eat a salad with too much vinaigrette and/or tangerine slices.   It's sweet, sour, and unpleasantly sharp.  It also makes the person you are talking to seem like they have body odor issues, sticky skin, and lack of hygiene.  If you eat this, eat something else afterwards that is hot, toasty, and spicy.</p>
<p>8. Hungry Breath</p>
<p>If you have ever been really really hungry, you have had this breath. It smells like dry mouth. Sort of faintly sweet, with a weird aroma of oldness to it.  Solution: Eat.   Once you start salivating, it will stop stinking.</p>
<p>9. Apple Juice Breath</p>
<p>Sickeningly sweet. A touch of sour. and hot. Super uncomfortable to be around.  Don't let it be the last thing in your mouth. I used to like this girl, and she had apple juice breath once, and forever after, I avoided talking to her.</p>
<p>10. Orange Juice Breath</p>
<p>Same story as above except less sweet, more sour, and very very sharp.  There was another girl, she had orange juice breath, she was also white, and afterwards, I started associating orange juice breath with white people...I don't know, psychological issues I know.</p>
<p>11. Watermelon Breath</p>
<p>Same as above.  Same experience, different girl.  Notice that all the girls eat fruit, but what they do not realize is the product of such fruit after it begins to rot on their tongues...sick.</p>
<p>12. Leek Breath</p>
<p>This one is mainly for asians.  We eat dumplings packed with pork and leeks.  The result is like farting from your mouth.  The worst case scenario is if you burp, then the smell of leek, compounded with its decomposition from your stomach, turns up into a disgusting smell that will kill all your chances with that girl.  I once had a bowl of leek dumplings before going to a junior high dance, only to burp ont he dance floor, and every single person around me for a 5 ft. radius backed away and I had to pretend it wasn't me.  devasating in power and especially effective on white people (due to unfamiliarity of flavor)</p>
<p>And there you have it folks.  12 types of bad breath to watch out for.  All to say, every one should scrape their tongues both morning and night and maybe in the middle of the day...</p>
