<p>Everytime I have a fever i get senseless.  Really Really senseless.  When I was suffering form food poisoning in Japan, I kept thinking that my bed sheets composed a battleship and my brother who was sleeping next to me kept firing canon balls at me. The thing is, I was super convinced of the legitimacy of this concern.</p>
<p>This time, I kept on thinking that the position of my sleep was a building, and I was an architect that had to find the ultimate position.  If I didn't I would never be able to sleep.  I was also convinced of the legitimacy of this concern.</p>
<p>My final thought before knocking out was this . All this architectural building is so postmodern and relative.  I fell asleep to the thought of a Sermon with multiple points about being the Biblical man.</p>
<p>what a crazy night.</p>
