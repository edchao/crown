> Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led around by the Spirit in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by the devil. (Luke 4:1)

Jesus was filled with the Holy Spirit and yet was tempted by Satan. See how the power of the Spirit's influence does not nullify the reality of temptation, it only strengthens one's sensitivity to it.
