<p>For sure, I&#39;ve been incredibly encouraged lately.&nbsp; Perhaps it&#39;s getting out of a week-long sickness.&nbsp; Perhaps it&#39;s enjoying C.S. Lewis imagination in the Voyage of the Dawn Treader, perhaps its my smallgroup guys stepping up the pace in their own lives and seeking to be mature when the world around them says &quot;you&#39;re young, there&#39;s time to waste&quot;.&nbsp; Perhaps its reading books that force me to discipline my mind.&nbsp; Or perhaps, this would be best of all, I&#39;ve just been loving the Scriptures more.&nbsp; Whatever it is, or whatever combination it is, the Lord has been doing great things for me and within me.&nbsp; It is a season of peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a verse that I have been meditating on regarding the Fear of the Lord.&nbsp; When I used to attend church in Junior high I was taught the fear of the Lord does not include dread or a sort cringing fear.&nbsp; Isaiah has taught me differently.&nbsp; The Lord is both terrible in Holiness as well as overwhelming in compassion.&nbsp; The two attributes simply run together like water colors bleeding into one another.</p>
<p>&quot;But the Lord of Hosts, Him you shall regard as Holy.&nbsp; Let Him be your fear and let Him be your dread and he will become a sanctuary AND a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel.&quot; - Isaiah 8:13-14&nbsp;</p>
