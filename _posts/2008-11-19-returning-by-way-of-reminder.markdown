<p>It's been awhile since I last wrote down my thoughts here but I figured it was a good time, and there have been many happenings since the last entry.</p>
<p>But first I'd like to share a few thoughts.  My first thought is more of a discovery than anything else.  It is this, that the happiest, fullest moments of my life were not when I started dating or when I got accepted to the college of my choice, or even when I got the gifts I wanted for christmas/my birthday/random acts of kindness.  The happiest moments of my life were when I knew in my heart of hearts that I was right with God, that I was walking in His way, and that I was ministering to his people.</p>
<p>There has been a recurring thought in my mind these past few days, the thought is seminary.  Not because I'd like to fall back on it, or because I thought I did alright with ministry in college, but because the thought of it alone is enough to create a warm feeling in my chest.  I tried to escape this sentiment for a good long while, but it seems to have caught up with me. Anyhow, I'm starting to think it over seriously.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean I'm going to follow through, it just means that for once in my life, the possibility is very real and very close and the desire for the task is becoming overwhelming.  Of course, I don't think I'm worthy of going to seminary.  There are countless sins and failures in my life that should disqualify me permanently, I've been brought down from glorious heights, and humbled in ways I never thought I'd have to experience... but I think the possibility of becoming a pastor is worth looking into, especially when the call alone brings an inexplicable joy.</p>
<p>okay, end thought.</p>
<p>In other news, I've moved home and work out of my home office. I started dating a girl I met in taiwan named xiao-ru.  And people are starting to get married in my class. I miss GOC still and somewhere deep inside I still want to serve alongside Justin Mckitterick, Jim Ayres, and Steve Tu some day...</p>
<p>May the will of the Lord be done in my life.</p>
