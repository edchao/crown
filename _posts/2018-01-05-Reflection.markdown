God is not bound by an external moral standard. Rather, what we know as moral law is merely a faint and often incomplete interpretation of God's character. This is why the rules and regulations for human behavior (as recorded in Scripture) are the subject of change. The interpretation of God's character progresses as revelation progresses. A regulation on diet once was the best way to communicate God's holiness but no longer. Though time has shifted the looking glass, the subject of its reflection remains the same.
