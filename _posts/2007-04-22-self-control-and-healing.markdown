<p>By now I've become very familiar  with the process of getting hurt and watching my body heal.  Whether it be a large cut or a small cut, it all goes through same process of fixing itself.  First, when the wound is inflicted, a sharp pain, then a uncomfortable throbbing feeling, then the scab begins to grow, then the itchiness, then the scratching, then the wound reopens, and all over again until I finally keep myself from scratching it again.</p>
<p>Wounds in the heart are like that too, almost at every level.  And until you stop scratching the itch you'll never heal up. It's all about self-control really. Control your thoughts, and your heart will heal itself.  You might not feel like brand new but at least you'll feel like you've healed.</p>
