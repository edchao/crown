> We give thanks to God always for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers; constantly bearing in mind your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father (1 Thess 1:2-3)

Faith is the conviction.
Hope is the attitude.
Love is the action.

This is the inextricable trinity of godliness. Each piece completes the others.
