<p>I love this account.</p>
<blockquote><p>““Since the beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind. “If this man were not from God, He could do nothing.” They answered him, “You were born entirely in sins, and are you teaching us?” So they put him out.</p>
<p>Jesus heard that they had put him out, and finding him, He said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?” He answered, “Who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?” Jesus said to him, “You have both seen Him, and He is the one who is talking with you.”</p>
<p>And he said, “Lord, I believe.” And he worshiped Him.</p>
<p>(John 9:32-38 NAS95S)</p></blockquote>
