<p>When I have a rough day, or when I am feeling particularly cluttered, or when something is wrong and I just can't put a finger on it, I usually clear my mind with two things.</p>
<ol>
<li>Theological reading</li>
<li>Prayer</li>
</ol>
<p>Theological reading brings your mind out of the murkiness of the day and into the light of theological truth.  It's difficult to feel emO and intellectually dull when the glory of God is blazing your face off.  Night becomes day.  And all the brain haze gets sucked away leaving only intense clarity.</p>
<p>What prayer does that is even more wonderful than theological reading is it takes all your burdens, and your unspoken anxieties and lays them down before our triple O (Omni-present,-potent,-scient) God so that you can lay your head down on your pillow and sleep.  Some people cry out their sorrows, I just pray them out and trust that I'm in good hands.</p>
<p>These are old lessons.  But they still work. Here I release an extended sigh (sigh...)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>also...I started using a nib.Â  It's amazing the sort of precision, cleanliness of line, and overall classiness you get from such a primitive tool. It cannot be duplicated by rolling balls, ballpoints, plastic tips, or brushes. Here's a pic.</p>

<p>classy!</p>
