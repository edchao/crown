<p>Sometimes we feel like we can't change.  We think to ourselves that we are far too set in our ways to ever live differently.  Some of us just feel too weak to start anew.   Years have come and gone and habits have only grown deeper.  You're asking me to change?  I can't. Not anymore.</p>
<p>"Impossibility" in Christians is of course wrong thinking.  Before I say anything substantial, it is a fact that everyone can change to some degree.  If people who do not know the Lord can change behaviour by sheer will and conditioning then those who know the Lord of Renewal and Transformation can change too.  We can at least say that much.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered, How did little Zaccheus change?  He's a good example.  How did this greedy tax collector suddenly let go of his love for riches and more importantly how did he break through all those years of built up habit?  He did not become a slave of money and a traitor to his people overnight.  His roots grew into the lifestyle over many, many years.  And yet, beyond all expectation, when Jesus appeared, his heart gave way... something inside of him changed drastically and the next thing he did was 180 degrees opposite from what he had been accustomed to, indeed what he could not help but do for so many years.  Instead of hoarding and stealing money, he gave it all away.</p>
<p>Real change, not behavior modification, happens when God sheds a piercing light into the heart.  Real change happens when we at last see and savor the Glory of Christ. I'm going to say that again.  When we AT LAST!  SEE! and SAVOR! the GLORY! of CHRIST!  Because in that beautiful realization, that the God of the universe is standing before us, the sheer weight of His Divine presence lifts our thoughts like a mighty current away from our finite, weak, selves and causes us to dwell upon the infinite, omnipotent, GOD who is calling us to walk with Him.  I bet that's what Zaccheus felt as he stared into the face of his Maker.  He couldn't think of his habits now and the influence they had over him.  He could only think ..."Oh my God."</p>
<p>The strength to start something in the heart, happens not by the ability or will of man but by the ability and will of a Supreme Being named Jesus. We are no longer dealing with the power of habit now.  We are dealing with the infinite power of God.</p>
<p>Let's compare two verses.  The first describes the ability of man and the second, the ability of God.</p>
<p>The Ability of Man:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Can the Ethiopian change his skin<br />
Or the leopard his spots?<br />
<strong> <font color="red">   Then you also can do good<br />
Who are accustomed to doing evil. </font></strong>”<br />
(Jer 13:23 NAS95S)</p></blockquote>
<p>The Ability of God:</p>
<blockquote><p>“  And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. Among them <strong> <font color="red">we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath </font> </strong>, even as the rest. <strong><font color="red"> But God,</font></strong> being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, <strong><font color="red">made us alive</font></strong> together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship, <strong> <font color="red">created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them. </font></strong>”<br />
(Eph 2:1-10 NAS95S)</p></blockquote>
<p>If God is real, we can all change.</p>
