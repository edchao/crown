<p>Elementary school kids graduate with a knowledge of 2,500-3,000 words.Â  That's level 3-4.</p>
<p>Junior High kids are level 5-6 (majority of modern novels, newspaper)</p>
<p>High School kids are level 7-8 (literature)</p>
<p>College kids are level 9 and up. (historic/classical literature)<br />
I am level 1 -_- with less than a thousand words under my belt. Talk about humbling. Laugh if you like, I deserve the shame.</p>
