<p>a quick update.  Not much is new.  I am interning at a web design company named <a href="www.varien.com" title="varien">Varien</a> in Palms which basically takes up all my time.  Usually after I come home, I eat a quick dinner, try to go play basketball and when that's over, I read or study the Scriptures.  And then I sleep.  It's weird when your days are so short.</p>
<p>I've been reading/listening to a lot of C.S. Lewis as of late.  It's refreshing to hear something academic addressed indirectly through allegory.</p>
<p>My cousin Jenny is getting married in another week! holy cow!</p>
