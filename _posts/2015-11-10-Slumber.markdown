> My help comes from the LORD, Who made heaven and earth. He will not allow your foot to slip; He who keeps you will not slumber. Behold, He who keeps Israel Will neither slumber nor sleep. (Psalm 121:2-4)

We spend one third or our life in a state of unconscious stupor.  Even the strong man becomes a child in his sleep. Indeed we are exceedingly helpless. It is our sleep that draws a foil to our God. The One who by His strength fashioned the heavens and earth, has no gap of vulnerability, no need of slumber. He is omnipotent; Always. And the Keeper of Israel is also the Keeper of the Church.
