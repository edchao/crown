<p>so I got back from the gym, threw on some pork chops onto the pan and made some rice.  No veggies, not necessary at this point.  Anyways, I'm eating at my table and I'm pretty much done with my meal. I've just got a little bit of rice stuck in the bowl here and there and one last chunk of meat.  I take the fork to the meat and and with the meat impaled on my fork, start to brush all the rice into a little clump.  And then I realize, I'm using the chunk of meat like a spoon.</p>
<p>At this point, I giggle.</p>
