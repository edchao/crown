<p>The temperature has dropped down to 78.  There's a cool breeze sifting through the window and the smell of someone frying something awesome.  I've got the kettle on and it'll start whistling soon.  I'm thinking a bowl of oatmeal will be the perfect brunch / pre-lunch snack.  Shane barnard is singing his heart out on the speakers and I'm feeling the joy of a clean conscience and a God-ward heart.  EBCT is having a welcome night tonight and I look forward to seeing my new found buddies again.  I'm still reveling in the strangeness and the the joy of having brothers and sisters of like mind here on the distant shores of Taiwan.</p>
<p>It's morning's like this that make me lean back, put my hands on my head and smile really, really obnoxiously.</p>
<p>I feel blessed beyond belief.</p>
