<p>It really seems like it doesn't it?  We only have so much "caring" to go around and so some get more others get less and those unfortunate nobodies get none at all.  That's lame.</p>
<p>The influence of self-love, self-preservation, self-exaltation, whatever you'd like to call it is prevalent in Christian circles.  Even the known "servants" of a fellowship group fall prey to its influences.  But hey, can't a guy get a break?  A guy can only care for so many people right?  True.  Nobody is perfect.  Caring for the world is not the responsibility of any one man.  But that's not the point I'm trying to make.  The point is not that we need to be caring to 100% of the population, but that we need to be 100% caring to whoever comes knocking on our doors and knocking mind you does not mean they actuallly knock on our physical doors and say "care for me."  Knocking can be a look, a fallen countenance, a drag in the step, a dip in their tone.  It can even be shutting out the public.  That's knocking.  It's as active as a depressed soul can be.</p>
<p>So when people knock, for goodness sakes answer.   If you look and listen hard enough you will find that there are hundreds of knocks a day.</p>
<p>Let's defy this lame Law.  We have the Spirit of Christ.</p>
