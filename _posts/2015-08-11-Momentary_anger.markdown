> For His anger is but for a moment, and His favor is for a lifetime. (Psalm 30:5)

During this season of mortal life, Godâ€™s anger is as nothing compared to His favor. While the lightning of His anger flashes forth, the clouds of His kindness become heavy with rain.  In a moment they will pour down favor on the repentant.
