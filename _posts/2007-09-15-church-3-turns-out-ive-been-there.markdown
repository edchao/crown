<p>Turns out, when I went on my last missions trip to taiwan with Beland, we shared our testimonies at this church.  In fact, Beland preached a sermon here.  It's an interesting place.  They have guest speakers every week and a lots of college kids my age.  It's also close to my apartment.  The down side is that they have guest speakers every week and no real permanent pastor, hence, as expected, their doctrine is a bit slippery and hard to pin down.  Furthermore, they have women preach from the word in the church, which to someone more liberal is cool but for someone from a conservative reformed background, it's a bit weird, and scripturally sketch.  Well anyways, I won a Bible verse competition and got a free book today. so yay.</p>
<p>I'm leaning away from Eastbay baptist now and leaning towards 松山教會. That's the one with the cool seminoid who's teaching hermeneutics and 1 Timothy.  Man...so much pressure.  I feel bad cuz theyre all so nice.</p>
