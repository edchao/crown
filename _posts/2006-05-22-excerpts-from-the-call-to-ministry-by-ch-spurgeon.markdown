<p>1.	&ldquo;The first sign of the heavenly calling is an intense, all-absorbing desire for the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>a.	&ldquo;Do not enter the ministry if you can help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>b. &ldquo;If any student in this room could be content to be a newspaper editor, or a grocer, or a farmer, or a doctor, or a lawyer, or a senator, or a king, in the name of heaven and earth let him go his way; he is not the man in whom dwells the Spirit of God in its fullness, for a man so filled with God would utterly weary of any pursuit but that which for which his innermost soul pants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>c. &ldquo;We must feel that woe is unto us if we preach not the gospel; the word of God must be unto us as fire in our bones, otherwise, if we undertake the ministry, we shall be unhappy in it, shall be unable to bear the self-denials incident to it, and shall be of little service to those among we minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2. &ldquo;In the second place, combined with the earnest desire to become a pastor, there must be aptness to teach and some measure of the other qualities needful for the office of a public instructor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>a.	&ldquo;If any man be called to preach, he will be endowed with a degree of speaking ability, which he will cultivate and increase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>b. &ldquo;I should not complete this point if I did not add that mere ability to edify, and aptness to teach, is not enough; there must be other talents to complete the pastoral character. Sound judgment and solid experience must instruct you; gentle manners and loving affections must sway you; firmness and courage must be manifest; and tenderness and sympathy must not be lacking. Gifts administrative in ruling well will be as requisite as gifts in teaching as well. You must be fitted to lead, prepared to endure, and able to persevere. In grace you should be head and shoulders above the rest of the people, able to be their father and counselor&hellip;If such gifts and graces be not in you and abound, it may be possible for you to succeed as an evangelist, but as a pastor you will be of no account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3. &ldquo;In order to further to prove a man&rsquo;s call, after a little exercise of his gifts, such as I have already spoken of, he must see a measure of conversion-work going on under his efforts, or he may conclude that he has made a mistake, and therefore, may go back by the best way he can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>a.	&ldquo;Surely it were better to be a mud-raker, or chimney-sweep, than to stand in ministry as an utter barren tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>b. &ldquo;Brethren, if the Lord gives you no zeal for souls, keep to the lapstone or the trowel, but avoid the pulpit as you value your heart&rsquo;s peace and your future salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4. &ldquo;The will of the Lord concerning pastors is made known through the prayerful judgment of His church. It is needful as a proof of your vocation that your preaching be acceptable to the people of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>a. &ldquo;Standing up to preach, our spirit will be judged of the assembly, and if it be condemned, or if, as a general rule, the church is not edified, the conclusion may not be disputed, that we are not sent of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of the chapter Spurgeon mentions John Newton&rsquo;s criteria for the call to ministry. They are similar to Spurgeon&rsquo;s:</p>
<p>1.	&ldquo;A warm and earnest desire to be employed in this service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2. &ldquo;Besides this affectionate desire and readiness to preach, there must be in due season appear some competent sufficiency to His gifts, knowledge, and utterance. Surely, if the Lord sends a man to teach others, He will furnish him with the means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3. &ldquo;That which finally evidences a proper call, is a correspondent opening in providence, by the gradual train of circumstances pointing out the means, the time, the place, of actually entering upon the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here are a few more convicting statements Spurgeon makes at the end of this chapter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fervent lovers of souls do not wait till they are trained, they serve their Lord at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus Christ deserves the best men to preach His cross, and not the empty-headed or shiftless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must try whether we can endure brow-beating, weariness, slander, jeering, and hardship; and whether we can be made the off-scouring of all things, and be treated as nothing for Christ&rsquo;s sake. If we can endure all these, we have some points which indicate the possession of the rare qualities which should meeting in a true servant of the Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>
