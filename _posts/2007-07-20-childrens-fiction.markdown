<p>There is something curious about children's fiction, some distinct and mysterious secret.  Don't you ever wonder why people gravitate towards it rather than other literary genres? Perhaps it is the purity of emotion, the simplicity of uncorrupted character...  Well,whatever it is, I have begun to think that children's fiction contains some unspecified quality that is super conducive to empathy, a common denominator for readers of all ages if you will.</p>
<p>So after Harry Potter I'm going to read either His Dark Materials, Percy and the Olympians, or Silmarillion. If anyone comes aross anything comparable in quality and originality to Harry Potter or Narnia, please let me know.</p>
<p>Happy reading to all!</p>
