<p>I picked up a few movies today. Blade-Trinity, Eragon, and Children of Men.</p>
<p>I also watched Pan's labyrinth tonight for 2 bucks at Ackerman.</p>
<p>That's a lot of movies.  Here are my reviews thus far:</p>
<p>1. Blade-Trinity.  Good action, woefully (or wonderfully, depending on who you ask) cheesy punchlines,  but vampires + big guns +kung fu? hard to miss the target.  Some unnecessary scenes though.  It's exactly what you bargain for.  A black vampire doing roundhouse kicks to the face.</p>
<p>2. Pan's Labyrinth. dark, suspenseful, and excruciatingly violent.  Reminds me of my dreams when I was in elementary school which were borderline nightmarish. Personally, I loved it. It was pure nostalgia.  It's the sort of magic kids experience when their imaginations are forced to function in the real world.</p>
<p>to come, Eragon (I hear that it is easily one of the worst films of the year, Rotten Tomatoes says watching it makes you lose the will to live)  and Children of Men (I hear it's one of the best films of the year)</p>
<p>Hopefully I'll get to watch them all.  Yay.</p>
