<p>Perhaps a verse to start it off.</p>
<p>““Do not worry then, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear for clothing?’ “For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.”<br />
(Matt 6:31-33 NAS95S)</p>
<p>Lord we're still waiting, μαραναθα,</p>
<p>the Spirit and the Bride say come!</p>
