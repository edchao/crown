<p>This weekend was very eventful.  On Thursday night I came down with some sort of food poisoning by eating some strange food in the dorms.  The morning after I was nauseous, coming out both ends and deeply feverish.  There are many stories to tell concerning that day and a half but perhaps another time.  <a href="http://www.resolved.org">Resolved Conference</a> started on Friday so I missed that session.  I also missed the morning session on Saturday.  But it's okay because I ended up watching <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/EventMessages/ByDate/1979_The_Holiness_of_Christ/" title="The Holiness of Christ">R.C. Sproul's video sermon</a> online, which I really recommend.  If there's anyone I like more than John Piper it's Sproul (or Steve Lawson).</p>
<p>But concerning Piper,  This was the first time I've seen the man live.  It was very cool.  Exactly what I expected, dynamic, insightful, and profoundly biblical.  What I took away was a reminder to take Scriptural teaching to its ultimate implications, to be the Christian who lives Christianity to its logical end and of course to seek to enjoy God Himself as the ultimate goal of all things.</p>
<p>So in short, I'm very happy about this weekend.  I feel like I've lost a great deal of spiritual focus in the last year and  half but I think I found it again at Resolved 07.</p>
