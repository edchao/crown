> Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
(Matt 5:8)

An oldie but a goodie. Business travel is tricky. You're alone at night and it's tempting to do unholy things with your spare time. But God has called us to something higher; a superior pleasure. The hard part is remembering and savoring, and not letting your fleshly appetites take over. Almost like... fighting to fight at all, if that makes sense. But when you do, God is oh-so-good, and He never fails. Sin??? Why??? Why pick the inferior? A preposterous proposition, I tell you. Praise God that there is great reward for those who pursue purity: they shall see Him.
