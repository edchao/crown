That which our physical limitations can not engage: what our eyes cannot see, what our hands cannot reach can only be apprehended through the imagination. It is our imagination that enables us to ascend the heights of glory. God has granted it to us for this very purpose.

But for many, the enemy has usurped this distinctive faculty. Yet we are not left without fault. There is a traitor within. We ourselves have allowed darkness to assume power. Our passive embrace of worldly entertainment and idle thinking unlocks the door to the bridge. This divine vessel meant to ferry our minds to heaven's door has been seized by sheer neglect.

Yet will we not battle for the helm? Will we not strive to reclaim control of our imagination? Rather than feed off the fantasies of this world, let our imaginations race towards Heaven with visions of Divine glory.
