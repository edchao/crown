That which our physical limitations can not engage: what our eyes cannot see, what our hands cannot reach is apprehended through the imagination. Truly, it is our imagination that enables us to ascend the distant heights of glory. God has granted it to us for this very purpose.

But for many of us, the enemy usurped our imagination. But we are not left without fault. For there is a traitor within. We ourselves have allowed him to assume power. Our passive embrace of worldly entertainment and idle thinking has unlocked the door to the bridge. This divine ship meant to ferry our minds to heaven's door has been seized by sheer neglect.

Yet will we not battle for the helm? We must strive to reclaim control of our imagination.  Our minds are feeding off the fantasies of this world, when they should be racing with countless thoughts of Divine glory.
