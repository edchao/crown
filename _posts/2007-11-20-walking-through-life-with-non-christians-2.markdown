<p>For the past couple of months, there has been one big difference in my life in comparison to my college days.  Unlike those four years at UCLA, here in Taipei, I have more friends who are non-Christians than friends who are.  Furthermore, I spend about the same amount of time with them as with my church buddies.</p>
<p>It really is a big difference... especially if you're used to on-campus fellowship life like me (e.g. living in apartments or dorms next to a whole row of your fellowship friends.)  When you live alone in the city, and there are no events to go to, and it takes a train ride or a long walk to see your church homies, life changes.  Instead of walking through life with fellow believers in the Lord, you learn to walk alongside people who don't believe in the same things you do.  It's different, but I've learned to love it.  Here are some situations that I have come across which I'd like to give a brief commentary on.</p>
<p>1. Integrity</p>
<p>It's huge.  If you lose your integrity you lose everything. Do something stupid and you sully the name of Christian, and more importantly the name of Christ.  If I find myself compromising in ways that are obviously no-kay, then I might as well not call myself a follower of the Lord Jesus.  Furthermore, pursuing purity in this manner is not a public performance that loses its luster under the wear and tear of time. It should stand because the basis for it is our relationship with God, not man.  God forbid that I should start playing the part rather than genuinely pursuing the reality.</p>
<p>2. Friendship and the Nature of Tolerance</p>
<p>I love friends.  I truly believe with all my heart that Friends are one of the greatest graces that we can have in this world.  Now, there are numerous things I can say about the nature of friendship when it connects peoples of different beliefs.  Tolerance is one of those things that is indispensable.  As a Christian it is my job to be tolerant, but not to be a pushover.  Tolerance is not the same thing as Unitarianism.  Tolerance listens, Unitarianism mindlessly accepts.  Tolerance does not change it's own convictions to cater to other's convictions, it simply gives them the opportunity to explain themselves allowing for peaceful co-existence while preserving the purity of each respective conviction.  But it will never give up it's hold on what believes it to be truth, nor will it stop in heralding it.  We can believe different things while believing each other to be wrong.  Tolerance allows for that.</p>
<p>3. Sharing the Gospel</p>
<p>When you can you should.  I don't do it enough.  Walking through life with a Non-believer should never be without mention of Jesus. To be honest, it's hard to hide the fact that I am wrapped up in God.  If I keep talking, it'll eventually come out.  I can't help it.  You know, I think that's how it should be.  If you find that you immediately blend in without a hitch, and God easily slips into the background, something might be wrong. If Jesus is after all the center and the joy of your life, something of Him should come out whether or not you mean for it to.</p>
<p>Lastly, I think you should make it known that your desire is for your friends to come to a saving faith in Jesus.  They should know that you have a genuine concern for them.  Because even though it's not the nicest thing to say "I'm sad because you're going to hell." what else can you say?  That's just the simple truth if you believe in the Bible.  Sometimes I want to ask my friends "What do you want me to say then?"  I can't think of any other options that don't compromise convictions.</p>
<p>So long story short, I thoroughly enjoy walking through life with Non-Christians.  But it's a challenge.  I just need to remember who I am and stick to it.</p>
