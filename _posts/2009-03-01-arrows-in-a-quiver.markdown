<p>Today I didn't go to my home church.  I went to my old home church.  I guess it's not really home church anymore, but it still sort of feels like home, okay, well not as much these days.</p>
<p>I got to stop by a Sunday school class that was reading a book called, Tender Warrior. My first reaction was intense laughter. And then I realized it was the title of a book, not the creative imaginings of old asian church men.  Anyways, I sat in on the class, and listened, while playing Tap Defense, to the teacher talk about the image of children being the arrows in their fathers quiver as derived from Psalm 127.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="line-group"><span class="verse-num">3 </span>Behold, children are a heritage from the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>,<br />
the fruit of the womb a reward.<br />
<span class="verse-num">4 </span>Like arrows in the hand of a warrior<br />
are the children<span class="footnote"> </span>of one's youth.<br />
<span class="verse-num">5 </span>Blessed is the man<br />
who fills his quiver with them!<br />
He shall not be put to shame<br />
when he speaks with his enemies in the gate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="line-group"><span class="footnote">If you think about it, it's a rather cryptic verse.  But anyways, it was quoted in the book (ie Tender Warrior) , authored by Stu Weber, a military  man turned pastor (also the name of a rather skillful guitarist).  His take on the verse is very interesting. creative. epic.  As I remember it, the illustration is meant to help us understand that as fathers, we must all learn to let go, like an arrow from the string of a taught bow.  Fatherhood is about learning to release our children like arrows into the heart of the....um, the future?  Something like that.  Anyways, it's about letting go.</span></p>
<p class="line-group"><span class="footnote">I think that's too creative, and too reminiscent of High School English.  The verse doesn't seem to be making that point.  Sure, arrows are let loose, but what does that have to do with a "Heritage" or a "Reward" or the hand of a "Warrior"? </span></p>
<p class="line-group"><span class="footnote">Here's what I think, and here's what I think is the right understanding.  Children are an inheritance, passed down from the Lord.  And the inheritance is our stewardship.  In middle eastern culture, the inheritance is passed down, added to, and passed down again.  Likewise children are given to us as a stewardship, and the stewardship changes hands when the children become fathers.  Children are also a reward, a treasure, a prize, a thing of great value.  Simple enough. So what then of the warrior's quiver?! </span></p>
<p class="line-group"><span class="footnote">The important question to ask is not, what part of the arrow/quiver/warrior picture can most naturally relate to children, but rather <strong>what is the mind of a warrior when his quiver is full of arrows that should make him happy </strong>(i.e. "blessed").  In ancient Israel, the warrior at the gate who carried a quiver of arrows was often stationed there in order to hold off a raiding adversary or instill fear in an enemy messenger.  The more arrows you had, the more you could shoot.  The more you could shoot, the more likely you would make an impact in the battle.  I'm not jumping any lines of logic here am I?   I think it's quite obvious why a full quiver of arrows would make a warrior happy, as compared to an empty one. It's no wonder why the psalmist says, "</span>He shall not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies in the gate."  If I were defending a stronghold, and the enemy came to negotiate, I would want not to bring one bullet in a gun, but a full vest of clips.  Wouldn't you? otherwise, you = epic fail.</p>
<p class="line-group"><span class="footnote">So no, I don't think it's about release, or even about letting go. The likeness between children and arrows, is clearly that both are purposefully contributed into the world.  The more arrows a warrior has, the more he can contribute to the battle.  The more children a father has, the more he can contribute to the cause of God.  They are our heritage that we must preserve, the vehicle that will carry our names into the future, and the cherished prize of our very lives.  When we raise our sons, we raise them in order that they don't waste their lives on video games and adolescent vegetation, but in order that one day they will affect change that will bring lasting honor to their families and to their God.  And the more children we have, the more opportunities we have for greater impact.</span></p>
<p class="line-group"><span class="footnote">A fitting quote concerning a fitting warrior.<br />
