<p>I've arrived in Taiwan.  Things are going well.  Registered for classes today.  Tommorow I'll see my apartment.  I think I'm getting a Lenovo for all you nerds out there.</p>
<p>Taiwan design is either digi or imitation-japanese.  Too bad.</p>
<p>I think I'm going to be in a class with a lot of white people.  The woman who tested me told me my reading and writing level was 50 percent of my speaking level.  That's pretty sad.  That means I can't take intensive courses until I shape up.  School starts Sept. 1</p>
<p>Oh, and I think I'll be going to <a href="http://www.ebct.org.tw/">Eastbay Baptist Taiwan</a> for Church.</p>
<p>My brother Jon is also successfully matriculated into Jefferson Med school.</p>
