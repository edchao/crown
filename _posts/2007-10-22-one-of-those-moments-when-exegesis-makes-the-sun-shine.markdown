<blockquote><p>a. 8 The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “ALL THE NATIONS WILL BE BLESSED IN YOU.”</p></blockquote>
<p>wait what? how?</p>
<blockquote><p>16 Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, “And to seeds,” as referring to many, but rather to one, “And to your seed,” that is, Christ.</p></blockquote>
<p>When God addressed Abraham, that "in you" the nations will be blessed, get this, He also addressed his Son.</p>
<p>He essentially said, "Jesus, you will bring about blessing to the Nations." How? Through the Cross.</p>
