<blockquote><p>“  For we know that if the earthly tent which is our house is torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For indeed in this house we groan, longing to be clothed with our dwelling from heaven, inasmuch as we, having put it on, will not be found naked. For indeed <b>while we are in this tent</b>,<b> we groan, </b>being burdened, because we do not want to be unclothed but to be (<i>further</i>)clothed, <b> so that what is mortal will be swallowed up by life</b>. Now He who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave to us the Spirit as a pledge” (2Cor 5:1-5 NAS95S)</p></blockquote>
<p>What's so great about having our mortal bodies swallowed up by life?  If your reply is "because it's cool to be immortal" That's the wrong answer.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord. (2Cor 5:6 ESV)</p></blockquote>
<p>The reason you and I should long for Immortality is because when our bodies are swallowed up by life, we will no longer be away from the Lord.  As we live, mortality is the last standing barrier between us and the one for whom we were created and exist.</p>
<p>I think about it often, meeting my Maker.  How precious, to know that there is only one experience for which I can say,  "I was made for this."</p>
