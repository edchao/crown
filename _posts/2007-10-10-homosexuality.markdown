<p>Homosexuality is rarely dealt with in detail among conservative evangelicals.</p>
<p>DGM does a great job covering it.  Find sermons, articles, and more <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/TopicIndex/80/">here</a>.</p>
<p>For all those who struggle in this regard.  Be encouraged, you are not alone, and the fight can be won.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Some people think you're not really saved if you still struggle with homosexual desire,    but I don't believe that's true. All Christians struggle with the temptation to sin. We    need to realize that a salvation experience is not a pre-frontal lobotomy or a substitute    for exercising personal discipline. God <em>does </em>bring change, but not always    instantaneously. And contrary to some popular belief, godly change does not always come    about without pain or struggle." - <em>Joe Hallet who <a href="http://www.leaderu.com/stonewall/pages/joe_h.html" target="_blank">came out of the homosexual life</a>  by the power of Christ and lived faithfully with AIDS, and eventually with his wife, until his death in 1997.</em></p></blockquote>
