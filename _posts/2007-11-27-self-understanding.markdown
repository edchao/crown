<p>I've never considered myself terribly strange.  Of course I've heard that in the past I've been labeled as something of an eccentric, perhaps awkward, or a bit more on the weird side.  But to be quite honest, if you know me, I'm not too far from the regular joe.  At this point, I'm sure many would scoff.  Read on.  Let me put it this way. I'm normal enough to be able to hold a conversation without causing people to turn tail and run.  Strangers don't walk into my apartment and freak out.  I don't wear clothes that makes people cringe and I don't have any exceedingly anti-social habits like eating my boogers or smelling others armpits.  I take showers often, use old spice deodorant, put on clean clothes each morning, eat 3 meals a day and try to stay fit.  I don't make it a hobby to stalk people or garner information about things I shouldn't know.  I'm not a hot-headed person or a psychotically sad emo or a hopeless bipolar.  Of course I'm not saying I don't get sad or angry, but the extremes are never that noticeable or common in my daily life.   I don't listen to weird music, or music that you can't understand how anybody could appreciate.  Even though I have hermit-like tendencies, I also enjoy being with people, enough that sometimes I'll get out just to find some friends.  I eat relatively normal things (for my nationality).  I try to be frugal.  I have excellent oral hygiene and I'm lazy with my contacts just like everyone else.</p>
<p>So in short.  I think I'm pretty normal.  Even though I might be a bit weird, everybody is weird in some ways, but hey, that's normal.  If you've got nothing special about you, well, I'm sorry but then you're just...weird.</p>
<p>I think that's why I don't have too much trouble making friends.  I don't scare people, or make them feel uncomfortable.  At least I try not to.  Sure, I'll throw in an awkward moment here or there to spice things up, but that's not so crazy or outlandish that people feel like they've got to scram.  Usually it makes for a good conversation starter or a good laugh.</p>
<p>But you know? I realized, that despite the fact that I'm not really that strange (...most people exaggerate, or make relative comparisons with stoic unfeeling boring people), I actually am strange. Because I am a Christian.  I don't mean to say Christianity is a strange religion.  I mean to say that to the outsider, to somebody who has not come to know the Lord, the Christian who lives for the glory of the One Holy God is something of a crazy.  Conservative Practice? Doctrine Lover? weird! In this post-modern world, where "relative" can be applied to everything and everybody and their mom, somebody who says "I believe in an absolute truth, that all men are sinners and destined for eternal punishment unless they wake up to the glory of God, repent and trust in the substitionary atonement of Christ on the Cross."  That's really weird!  And to be someone who puts God above everything, who spends free time going to preach the gospel to strangers on the street, what in the wide-world?!</p>
<p>So although I don't believe I am crazy.  I think people will think I am because I say things like "Jesus is my treasure!"</p>
<p>Nobody says anything like that outside of Christianity and gets away with it without being called a fruit.</p>
<p>So I'm starting to understand myself more these days.  Yeah, I might be able to sit down on a couch with some friends over coffee and talk about random aspects of pop culture.  Sooner or later, they're going to start arching their brows.  Christians are like clear oil in hot water.  You can mix it up real good but sooner or later it's got to separate.</p>
