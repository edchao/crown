<p>It was reeeeallly good.  Makes you think and wonder.  I have a lot of thoughts, the next entry will be on why Love is so deep and powerful and why God is the reason why it possesses those qualities.  I must admit there are times when we place Love over God, but it's wrong.  At the end of the movie or the end of the novel you throw yourself on your bed and think, boy love is the end all, but then something else is kicking in the background keeping you from settling on that conclusion.</p>
<p>Philip Pullman is a self-proclaimed atheist which is really strange to me.  Because he describes so many things which make no logical sense to the atheist, values and convictions so deep and rich and beautiful that random chance simply doesn't do it justice.  Well, that's it for now, more to come later.  And I still have to write on Galatians.</p>
