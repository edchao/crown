<p>it's morning time.  I just had romans study yesterday.  Couldn't stop thinking about it falling asleep and even when I woke up and in the shower it was the only thing on my mind.  Now I have work.  What a weird pair.</p>
<p>I think I'm going to write something here later about the meaning and use of Habakkuk 2:4 for all the confused Romans Returnees.</p>
<p>okay, going to work now.</p>
