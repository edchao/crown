> Praise the LORD, all nations! Extol him, all peoples! For great is his steadfast love toward us, and the faithfulness of the LORD endures forever. Praise the LORD! (Psalm 117)

The unshakeable, everlasting nature of God's truth and love towards us are enough to write a psalm on. Doesn't matter if it's a short one!
