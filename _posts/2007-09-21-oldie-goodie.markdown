<p>I went to Oldie Goodie today, kinda like a music/jazz bar.  It was good.  Stinkin good...I came out smelling deeply of cigar/cigarette/cigarillo smoke.  Even my underclothes smelled like it.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the band was amazingly good.  It's really something special to see a 23 year old taiwan girl effortlessly playing the most rockin funk and jazz riffs on a double layered synthesizer.  In one minute she singlehandedly put all of asian boy korean-soap-fake-jazz piano players to  shame.</p>
