<p>During prayer, The Lord taught me this simple but profound truth:</p>
<p>Why pursue righteousness? Because the pursuit of righteousness heightens your experience of God. In other words, it deepens your relationship with Him. Why battle Sin? Because Sin drives a wedge between you and God. It dampens your relationship with Him.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
