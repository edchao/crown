<p>went there.  It was good.  The pastor here is named Matt, and he preaches like Matt Dillane back home.  Apart from that...the people are super nice and a lot of them speak really good english.  A bunch of tentmakers are here from Eastbay in Berkeley, and I'm serious when I say that all of them resemble somebody at GOC...it would be creepy if it weren't so amusing.</p>
