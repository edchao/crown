<p>Boy, there have been a lot of weddings recently.  But to be really really honest, I'm not tired of them.  I think sometimes I say I am because people expect me to be, but I'm really still so happy to go to them. To see so many friends and so many smiles, all the memories that make you fuzzy and giggly, they come right on back.  :) Congrats Albert and Vicky!</p>
<p>There really is nothing like a good Christian wedding to remind you of the meaning and purpose of life, in the final union of the church and Christ.  It gets me every time.  Just learned this song recently at Beland's church today:</p>
<blockquote><p>THERE IS A HOPE<br />
<em>by Stuart Townend and Mark Edwards</em><br />
<em>Copyright (c) 2007 Thankyou Music.</em></p>
<p><em>There is a hope that burns within my heart,</em><br />
<em>That gives me strength for ev'ry passing day;</em><br />
<em>a glimpse of glory now revealed in meager part,</em><br />
<em>Yet drives all doubt away:</em><br />
<em>I stand in Christ, with sins forgiv'n;</em><br />
<em>and Christ in me, the hope of heav'n!</em><br />
<em>My highest calling and my deepest joy,</em><br />
<em>to make His will my home.</em><br />
<em> </em><br />
<em>There is a hope that lifts my weary head,</em><br />
<em>A consolation strong against despair,</em><br />
<em>That when the world has plunged me in its deepest pit,</em><br />
<em>I find the Savior there!</em><br />
<em>Through present sufferings, future's fear,</em><br />
<em>He whispers, "Courage!" in my ear.</em><br />
<em>For I am safe in everlasting arms,</em><br />
<em>And they will lead me home.</em><br />
<em></em><br />
<em>There is a hope that stands the test of time,</em><br />
<em>That lifts my eyes beyond the beckoning grave,</em><br />
<em>To see the matchless beauty of a day divine</em><br />
<em>When I behold His face!</em><br />
<em>When sufferings cease and sorrows die,</em><br />
<em>and every longing satisfied,</em><br />
<em>then joy unspeakable will flood my soul,</em><br />
<em>For I am truly home.</em></p></blockquote>
