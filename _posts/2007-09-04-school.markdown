<p>school has begun.  I have two classes.  One class is M-F 10-1.  and another is M/W 4-6.  The first class is not hard yet, the second is a private tutor who makes me eat straw, in other words, it's really hard, and difficult to digest everything.</p>
<p>I picked up A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle, a childhood favorite, except I'm trying to read it in Chinese which makes for very slow reading.  Unfortunately I'm getting less time reading it than I would like, since I have homework.</p>
<p>So I think I have to decide between churches soon...I'm just not sure though.  Maybe I should cast a lot.</p>
<p>It's always raining here, makes for a pretty good motivation to study indoors. Hence, I have returned to my hermit sensibilities.</p>
