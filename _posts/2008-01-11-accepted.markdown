<p>I wish I wrote this song, because it speaks directly from and to my heart. It is the song of one unsatisfied by God, and the brokenness that results from faithless harlotry and the final question, "God will you still accept me?"</p>
<blockquote><p>If you could love me as a wife<br />
and for my wedding gift, your life.<br />
Should that be all I'd ever need<br />
or is there more I'm looking for</p>
<p>and should I read between the lines<br />
and look for blessings in disguise<br />
To make me handsome, rich, and wise<br />
Is that really what you want</p>
<p>I am a whore I do confess<br />
but I put you on just like a wedding dress<br />
and I run down the aisle<br />
and I run down the aisle<br />
I'm a prodigal with no way home<br />
but I put you on just like a ring of gold<br />
and I run down the aisle to you</p>
<p>So could you love this bastard child<br />
Though I don't trust you to provide<br />
With one hand in a pot of gold<br />
and with the other in your side</p>
<p>I am so easily satisfied<br />
by the call of lovers so less wild<br />
That I would take a little cash<br />
Over your very flesh and blood</p>
<p>Because money cannot buy<br />
a husband's jealous eye<br />
When you have knowingly deceived his wife</p>
<p>-Wedding Dress by Derek Webb</p></blockquote>
