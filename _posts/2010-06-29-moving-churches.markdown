<p>I've been thinking about going to GBF in Mountain View for a little while now.  Hard to say whether that's final or not but I really like it. If not for the unfortunate name which can also mean <a href="http://edchao.wordpress.com/2007/03/30/gbf-bgf/">girl boy-friend</a>, it would be pretty perfect for me.  :)</p>
<p>Although one thing that I have to say is it feels like GOC all over again.  Is that just a good thing?  I'm thinking about it.</p>
<p>But I do have to admit, the preaching/teaching is (sigh) SOOOOOOOOOOOOoo much better than the last two churches I've attended.  That congregation has no idea how blessed it is.  (okay maybe they do)  Now on to see whether or not they have junior high ministry opportunities.  And hopefully  that doesn't mean three white girls who've never seen an asian before.</p>
