> They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated 38 (men of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground.

Though itâ€™s true that thinking others are not worthy of you is often wrong and emerges from a prideful, entitled heart. There are the rare few, of whom such a phrase is true. My guess is that they would sooner die than acknowledge it though.
