<p>You don't need to be smart to understand the Scriptures or to study theology.  My gracious and long-suffering friends, you should all realize by now that I'm not smart.  I just read the material.</p>
<p>but that's not a big deal.  Even unbelievers read the material and are allowed to deduce the correct meaning from it.  What is a big deal is being changed by the Scriptures, being changed by the theology, and having it all well up into a big bucket of doxology.</p>
<p>Most of us who like "to know", just take the extra step to read up on our curiosities.  Sometimes we're just driven by the novelty of knowing something new.  But I've gotta say, curiosity never made people more holy,  and novelty never helped anyone walk more closely with God.</p>
