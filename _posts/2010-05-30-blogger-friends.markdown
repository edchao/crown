<p>There are not many friends that I follow in the blogosphere.   There are many reasons for this which I will not discuss at length here. However, there are a few writers that are always saying things that bring new light into my mind and heart.  A good friend and pastor of mine named Matt Hauck writes out of the richness of his God-saturated life.  Here is just one of the posts that has encouraged me in my walk with the Lord Jesus Christ.  It is a post I'd recommend every one of my friends to read.</p>
<blockquote><p>We just finished a Bible study series on decision making two weeks ago.</p>
<p>If I were to challenge you to do one thing, it would be this: <strong>Live your life based on reasons, not feelings</strong>.</p>
<p>I do not mean be "rationalistic", but be reasonable. The things we choose to base our life on should be founded in Scripture as the proper values, motives, goals in life. The one great overarching goal is to live a life of spiritual worship, i.e. a life that reveals for others to see the beauty and majesty and superabundant <em>worthiness</em> of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The way you do this when the rubber meets the road, whether it means choosing a job or a spouse, or what to eat for dinner varies from person to person, from situation to situation. Each person must have <em>reasons</em> for why s/he does what s/he does.</p>
<p>So don't live your life off of what you think God told you. Live your life on the complete word of God: the Bible. That is what it means to live by faith. It is trusting in God's word, not doing things irrationally (unless God's word teaches something the world thinks is irrational) or recklessly (unless God's word teaches something the world regards as reckless).</p>
<p>Don't live your life off of inward impressions or outward circumstances / opportunities. I don't trust my inward impressions (James 1:14-16). Impressions are impressions; opportunities are opportunities; all are to be <em>evaluated</em>. If they are followed or avoided, there should be <em>reasons</em> for doing so. Sometimes opportunities must be rejected, and sometimes they must be created. Sometimes ideas are good, sometimes they are bad. Just because they are <em>strong ideas makes them neither better nor worse just on account of that alone. </em></p>
<p>So that's basically it in a nutshell: Get a foundation for your life. Live your life based on reasons, not feelings.   <a href="http://matthauck.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/reasons-a-foundation-for-life.html">Permalink</a></p></blockquote>
