<p>(this is for my dear friend steve tu, who shares the same love as I do for the knicks and crannies of God's greatness)</p>
<p>An excerpt from Tim Keller's talk at Google:</p>
<blockquote><p>"C.S. Lewis writes an interesting article. In 1961, Some of you might know that the Russians were the first country to send somebody into space. Yuri Gagarin, and he came back and a few months later the premiere of the Soviet Union Kruscheve was agiving a speech and he was talking about atheism and said we sent somebody to heaven and he came back and he didn't see God anywhere.  CS lewis wrote an article an interestingly enough he said, 'If there is a God who created the world and created us, you don't relate to God the way a person in the first story relates to a man in the second story.  Rather you would relate to God the way hamlet relates to Shakespeare.  You see if Hamlet wants to prove there is a Shakespeare, he's not going to be able to do that in a lab nor is he going to be able to find shakespeare by going up into the stage. The only way he's going to know anything about shakepeare is if shakespeare writes something about himself into the play.  And what that would mean is if there is a Creator God, there is probably evidence, but the idea that you can't believe in him until someone proves him is actually a faith leap about the existence and nature of God before you know he is there.'"</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyways. The point I want to highlight is that we who call ourselves believers of God, are all like hamlet walking around in this providential quilt called reality believing in the power of the pen that writes tommorow.  But what's more amazing, is that God out of love and grace has written himself in.  The name of the Character is Jesus.</p>
