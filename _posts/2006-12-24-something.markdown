<p>The great breakers and gulfs and gatherings of grey</p>
<p>are split with a streak of white, electric flame</p>
<p>and just as suddenly as it flashes</p>
<p>all is cool, quiet, and new again.</p>
<p>It seems the ship is in manageable condition.</p>
<p>There's something fishy about it all really.</p>
<p>All so very orchestrated.</p>
