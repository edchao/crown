<p>Sometimes it feels like being in school makes me a kid;  like there is some sort of inherent property to education that implies immaturity or childishness in the student.  It's not true of course, I have seen thirty year olds walking the campus with back packs on and eighty year olds sitting in on my Religion lectures.</p>
<p>And yet, there's something there that's amiss.  The usual conclusion is that school is just completely different from the real world.  After all, most of us don't deal with workplace dynamics, or the gamut of insurance plans (health, dental, car, etc), taxes and figuring out deductions and exemptions, paying mortgages, investing in time-shares, stocks, financial bonds, insurance bonds and mutual funds, credit ratings and automobile purchases, how about keeping up with diplomatic relations concerning our country, who is who in the house and in the senate, are we republican or democratic or something else? The list of things we suddenly need to know seems to go on forever...</p>
<p>But you know what, even so, I shouldn't feel this way. That I am a kid because I don't know these things front and back.  Just because my current concerns fall under things like my DPR, GPA, Unit limit or managing a schedule conflict, being a student does not stunt the process of growing up.  I have no excuses for being a kid.  I used to think being an adult was all about externals and circumstance, thinking things like, "When you become an adult you start having to worry about this and that", but you know, It's not like that at all.  Adulthood is a state of mind and a condition of the heart.  How else can we be told, "gird up your loins like a man" if being a man was entirely dependent upon age?</p>
<p>A smart kid can play stocks, but he's still a kid.  A grown man can fail at understanding the differences between partnerships and common stock and he is no less of a man.</p>
<p>Maybe we're trying to grow up in the wrong ways.</p>
