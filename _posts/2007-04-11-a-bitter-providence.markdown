<p>This is a poem I wrote around two years ago, when I was a Junior in College.  It brought back some tough memories and even tougher lessons.  But I still stand by it.  I pray that I understand it better today.</p>
<blockquote><p><span>"...O King of mercy, God of Grace, Job knew it in the end,<br />
that providence releases praise through suffering's clenched hand</span></p>
<p>When walls of confidence are cracked and ruin hems us in<br />
When bricks we've stacked are blown to bits by unexpected winds<br />
the eyes that brim with tears are right to weep thought not for long<br />
for soon the same eyes shall perceive the suff'ring was not wrong.<br />
When man at long last finds himself with no word on his lips<br />
both foolish and intelligent will by Him be convinced,<br />
that God is God and He is wise beyond the mind of man<br />
He gives and takes away despite our ignorant demand<br />
for grace at all times in our life and in the shape and form<br />
of our idea of good when our idea falls ever short<br />
of what the Lord God has in mind, his kindness is not chained<br />
by what we say or think or dream, for Freedom is His Name.</p>
<p>So Lord I come with open hands to take what you will give.<br />
Regardless of the pain and grief that may well come with it.<br />
My hands are yours to take what you have chosen to bestow<br />
that I may see you better and your son more deeply know.<br />
Hear me Lord and grant me faith that fastens to Your Name<br />
for, the glory of the Sovereign God will surely be my strength."</p>
