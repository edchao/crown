<p>I met my new roomate today.  He's a bigger guy, not what I'm used to (i.e. steve tu) but hey, he's nice and can cover me when I don't know what's going on.  His name is zhang cheng zhe.  I have no idea what his English name is and he seems far to ashamed about it to let me in on the what and the why.</p>
<p>The apt. is getting there in terms of furnishing.  I've got my desk, bed, chair and printer.  Internet is getting hooked up tommorow morning, so I'll have that too soon enough.  More importantly I have my soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, brown sugar, oil and various chinese sauces.  I'm ready.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll go study my dictionary.  pictures are coming.</p>
