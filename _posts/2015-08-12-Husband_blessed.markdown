When I married my wife, I remember not being able to imagine loving her more than I did at the time.  I was insanely wrong. It seems that no matter how much my love grows for her, year after year, the heights grow higher.  And yet, this is just the love between creatures.  How much more does our love have to grow for our Creator, who is infinitely lovely.
