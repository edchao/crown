<p>Here, O Lord, descend and bring<br />
Your great salvation. Mighty King<br />
With scepter raised in victory,<br />
We watch you write the history,<br />
Of heaven and of earth and men.<br />
You hold the only sovereign pen.<br />
And now as days begin to wear<br />
The souls of Christians everywhere,<br />
On streets and ships and even graves,<br />
In nakedness and filthy caves,<br />
O come messiah, come and free<br />
The broken and the suffering.<br />
(Take hope, thereâ€™s more to what you see.<br />
The Lord, exceeds our wildest dreams<br />
Believe, and run the race ahead<br />
Your King, is waiting at the end.)</p>
