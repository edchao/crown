<p>(disclaimer: This is a semi-confusing post and you have to take it real slow to understand what I'm saying.)</p>
<p>Have you ever been in a situation where you went through some interesting circumstances and then came out of it saying, "Wow I didn't see it at the time, but that really turned out for my good!"  For example, a guy and a girl get together through strange or awkward situations and after they get married the husband says, "Boy! even though it didn't seem like it at the time, that really turned out for my good!" Or, how about this, "I didn't study for the test, but despite my lameness, somehow it worked out because the test got moved today, thanks God, you're working everything together for my good!"  How about this one. "Hey I know you didn't make the cut, but don't worry about it, God is working things out together for your good.  He's got better plans for you  yet."</p>
<p>These are all illegitimate uses of Rom 8:28.  Why?  Because it confuses "Our good (little g)" with "our Good. (humongous G)"  Paul is not just talking about any benefit, he is talking about ultimate and eternal benefit.  Check it out.  It should be pretty obvious.</p>
<blockquote><p> “  And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose. <strong><font color="red">For</font></strong> those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren; and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified.”<br />
(Rom 8:28-30 NAS95S)</p></blockquote>
<p>See the "For"? Paul is explaining what he means by "our good."  He has a specific meaning in mind and vs. 29-30 are the description.  Paul makes it very clear that the good God has in store for us is a big picture "awesome", not a little picture "doing swell." The purpose and goal for every believer is to be fully conformed to the image of Christ in the state of glorification.  That is the goal.  That is our final destination. That is our ultimate Good.  So then, if we are to be comforted by Rom 8:28, it should not be simply because God is watching our back.  Though that is not untrue.  We should be comforted because the limitless power of God is working within us to bring us into the state of <strong>Glory</strong>.</p>
<p>So if you want to enjoy the promise or encourage a friend with the promise of "He works together all things for our good," it is necessary to lock your gaze on this Glory.  Otherwise, you don't understand the promise. And you don't understand your "Good."  Rom 8:28 is an eschatological encouragement which derives its power from the sovereign will and power of God to bring it to pass. Your Good is not getting a break from homework right when you get sick (though that's nice),  Your Good is about getting eternal Glory.</p>
<p><font>I spent a long time laying in bed thinking about this last night before I knocked out.  I finally simplified the thought into this brief statement.</font></p>
<p><strong><font>The notion of "Our good" is determined by our goal, not by the state of each step.  If we reach our goal, the journey will indeed have been for our good.  If we do not reach the goal, then our journey will have been in vain and the "good" we enjoyed during our lifetime will have been worthless. </font></strong></p>
