> we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal. (2 Corinthians 4:18)

This verse speaks to the suffering. But it is just as true in the opposite circumstance. It would be an understatement to say that I enjoy my life. But it is important for me to remember that for all the joy I have in this life, it is fading fast. The place I should look, the place I should delight daily in and be motivated by is the unseen eternal.
