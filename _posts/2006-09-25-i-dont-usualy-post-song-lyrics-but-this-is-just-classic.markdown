<p><font color="#555555">"I know there are times, your dreams turn to dust. You wonder as you cry why it has to hurt so much.  Give Me all your sadness, someday you will know the reason why, with a child-like heart simply put your trust in Me.</font></p>
<p><font color="#555555">Take My hand and walk where I lead, keep your eyes on Me alone. Don't you say "why were the old days better", just because you're scared of the unknown.  Take My hand and walk.</font></p>
<p><font color="#555555">Don't live in the past cause yesterday's gone.  Wishing memories would last, you're afraid to carry on.  You don't know what's comin' but you know the one who holds tomorrow.  I will be your guide, take you through the night if you keep your eyes on Me.</font></p>
<p><font color="#555555">Take my hand and walk where I lead, you will never be alone.  Faith is to be sure of what you hope for and the evidence of things unseen so take my hand and walk.</font></p>
<p><font color="#555555">Just like a child holdings daddy's hand don't let go of mine.  You know you can't stand on your own.</font></p>
<p><font color="#555555"> Take My hand and walk where I lead, keep your eyes on Me alone. Don't you say "why were the old days better", just because you're scared of the unknown.  Take My hand and walk.</font> "</p>
