<p>Recently picked up <em>The Doctrine of God</em> by John Frame, the second book in his series "A Theology of Lordship."  It is a classic in the systematic study of Theology proper and I am excited to read it.  Also recently ordered Feinberg's <em>No One Like Him</em>, the alleged jewel of the book series, "Foundations of Evangelical Theology." All I hear are rave reviews.<br />
So, why the interest in Theology Proper?</p>
<p>Well, it should be no surprise that God is the greatest and most exhilarating thought that can ever pass through the mind of man.  But more than that I believe one of the most effective ways for a Christian to renew his mind and set it on the things above is by taking good long look at his Maker.  As an illustration which supports his proposition that mankind's ultimate pleasure is fulfilled and satiated by God, our beloved John Piper loves to say, "nobody goes to the grand canyon to increase his self-esteem."  If that is truly the case then, the study of God Himself, that is, the long gaze through Scripture's looking glass, is the means by which we will move towards ultimate Joy.  Studying Theology Proper is the like a spiritual version of standing at the edge of the Grand canyon and feeling the sheer magnitude of Majesty.</p>
