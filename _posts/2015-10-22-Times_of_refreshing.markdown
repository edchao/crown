What a clear and simple truth. That repentance and the blotting out of sin leads to times of refreshing. When I feel numb to the heat of Gods word, when the clarity of Christ's radiance is obscured by a dullened mind, it is repentance and the recognition of sins cleared, that enlivens my heart again.

Sometimes you don't know where to start. Start by identifying and repenting of your sins and let your mind dwell on the piercing truth that all of your sins are blotted out by Jesus.
