> Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you (Eph 4:31-32)

v31 is basically a typical corporate environment. v32 is what I’m called to live by, BECAUSE God has forgiven me through His Son. Lord give me grace each day to remember what I read this morning in Eph 4. When the air you breathe is v31, it’s so easy to get caught up in it all and join in. But if I do, I’ve basically forgotten that I’ve been changed, regenerated, and forgiven. How wonderfully practical the Scriptures are!
