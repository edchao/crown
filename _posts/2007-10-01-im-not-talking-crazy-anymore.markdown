<p>yes, it's been awhile. I liked talking crazy, but I don't want to refer to Bible study or Theological discussion as that anymore.</p>
<p>I think this one is more fitting.  I'm writing all of this stuff in hope.</p>
<p>in hope of what?</p>
<p>of the glory of God.</p>
<p>Μαρανα θα, Ο Ιησου, ο κυριος μου!</p>
