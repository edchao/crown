<p>It&#39;s hard to put your finger on.&nbsp; But it&#39;s a good feeling.&nbsp; And it comes after you have turned your eyes upon Jesus, having stopped your mind from thinking about all the doubts and fears which come when your attention settles upon yourself.&nbsp; In Christ, all fears are truly relieved.&nbsp; When the mind is fastened with faith upon the Sovereign, the heart must inevitably swell with trust, and immediately all the craziness of the day turns to powder and blows away.&nbsp; I know it&#39;s always semi-cheesy to quote lyrics, but I must admit I am very partial to cheesines in this moment.</p>
<p>In you I have found the wealth of my life<br />
Supreme in your beauty and grace<br />
To my soul, you alone, are my portion and cup<br />
my King and my Redeemer</p>
<p>In you, every hour, I shall strengthen my heart<br />
You&rsquo;re my rock, in the heart of the storm<br />
Let the wind and the rain turn my fears into faith<br />
My help and my deliverer</p>
<p>In you, there is peace for the darkest of days<br />
There is rest, in the knowledge of God<br />
Every fear, every doubt I surrender to You<br />
To my Shepherd and my Sovereign</p>
<p>In you, is my crown, and my glory and name<br />
I shall seek, what cannot fade away<br />
Make me deep in my trust that your Chosen shall come<br />
the Messiah and my Savior</p>
<p>In you, I shall find the release of my soul<br />
When I sing with a body renewed<br />
Every knee touch the ground, the whole earth shall resound<br />
With the voices of all the redeemed<br />
&nbsp;<br />
O In You, there is grace for the weakest of saints<br />
For the downcast a joy that remains<br />
There is rest for the broken and a hope for the faint<br />
Our God and Our Salvation<br />
&nbsp;</p>
