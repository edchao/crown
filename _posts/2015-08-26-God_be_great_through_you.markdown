> But Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?” (Exodus 3:11)

Imagine if you were Moses, and God says to you from the burning bush: "I am the God of your father... I have surely seen the affliction of my people...I am aware of their sufferings, so I have come down to deliver them... to bring them up...behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to Me...I have seen the oppression..." (Exodus 3:6-9). What would your response be? For many of us, our hearts would be ignited and we would say back to God, "Yes, Lord! Thank you for hearing the cries of suffering. Please save these people!" That would be an appropriate response in anticipation of God's hand to move. And yet, look at what the Lord says to Moses in the next verse (Exodus 3:10), "Therefore, come now, and I will send you to Pharaoh, so that you may bring my people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt."

Many times, if not all the time, this Great God accomplishes His amazing works through some not-so-great people. Moses was one those people; you may be one of those people. Don't think you have to be great for God to use you, but let God be great through you.
