<p>I suppose the title to this post is a bit misleading, though it is phrased exactly as Matt 23:6, Mark 12:39 and Luke 24:36, I don't intend to address the issue of the love of self via the hunger for man's praise, demonstrated in the Pharisees taking the seats of honor.  Though I do intend to address self-love.  The passage is not in the gospels but in Phillipians.  Can you guess?</p>
<p>Good guess:</p>
<p>â€œ Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves;   do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others."</p>
<p>Okay, then what is THIS seat of honor? it is a general concept that I am just now coming up with, the seat of honor is very simply "The best of" anything.  It could be the best seat in the house, the best parking spot, the best seat in the car (i.e. shotgun), the best whatever ... you name it.</p>
<p>I have found that we love to take the best for ourselves when it is in our power to give it to others.  We love to steal all the air conditioning and sit in the most comfortable chair in the apartment when others take the backseat or are forced to sit on the ground.  We love to eat all the good food before asking others if they want it, we love to assume that everyone is okay with us having the best of everything.  don't we?</p>
<p>Let me push it even further, forget materialistic pleasures, how about emotional and social pleasures? such as taking the easy route in conversations and ending it when you've found out their major and year? Or perhaps in more heated conversations, it is more of a passive aggressive way to pleasure? maybe it comes out in sarcasm? (which is so very common in this day and age of dry wit) c'mon, it's easy! and it gets you out of some hairy situations while looking good.</p>
<p>I do it.  I know it.  Shamefully, we are all children who have not yet grown up, not yet understood manners and what is right and noble.  The gentlemen of today are not gentle and they are not men.  But let me say also that the ladies of today are not ladies either nor are they truly women.  They are little girls who have forgotten to grow up and in the process have skipped lessons in manners.  It is rare to find people who place others above themselves both in the material as well as in the social realm.  When was the last time you talked to a guy who would give anything and everything to you even before you asked? when was the last time you spoke to a girl who didn't have some sort of sarcastic bent and a jaded worldview?</p>
<p>We all lift ourselves up.  Some do it more obviously, others more subversively, but it is all the same self-love that drives it.  Today I may throw some sarcasm here to take the easy and most comfortable way out of a difficult or annoying conversation, tommorow I may jump into the front seat of my friends car while the rest boil physically and emotionally in the backseat.</p>
<p>you know the rest of the verse in Phillipians, read it.</p>
