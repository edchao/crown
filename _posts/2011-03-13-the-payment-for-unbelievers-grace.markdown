<p>If every moment of our lives as christians is blood bought and paid for by the death of Christ, then what of the lives of unbelievers? </p>
<p>The answer may be surprising, but it is consistent with the biblical coexistence of grace and justice. The mercies and blessings unbelievers experience by simply living will also be paid for someday. However it will not be paid for by Christ, but rather paid for by themselves forever under eternal punishment. This is why Paul writes that unbelievers are "storing up wrath for themselves on the day of wrath". And why Peter refers to life as the "patience of the Lord". God waits daily for the repentance of unbelievers. But one day patience will turn into accountability.</p>
<p>This is proven through the necessity of Christ's death for our life,  past, present, and future. Therefore it is also necessary for payment to be given for unbeliever's lives. Except without the ransom of Christ they only have themselves to make the payment. Sobering indeed.</p>
