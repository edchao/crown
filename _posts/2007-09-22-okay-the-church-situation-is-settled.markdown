<p>Eastbay Baptist it is.</p>
<p>I will still be buddies with the other churchies but I'm going to settle and invest at EBCT.  The answer is clear.</p>
<p>Why? Would you believe it, it has to do with Eschatology and Ecclesiology. Never thought that would come in handy did ya.</p>
<p>The other church which I love deeply, is also deeply reformed in its theology which is rockin, but that means they are also majority covenantal and so disagree with certain key points of dispensational theology.  I don't think its an issue to divide us as fellow bondservants in Christ, but if there is a church that teaches dispensational theology and premil, pretrib rapture, I'm super down.</p>
<p>I guess I just can't let go of looking forward to an imminent, unpredictable, return of our glorious King.  It's too awesome.</p>
<p>(So if you're reading this Matt, you are now my pastor and I am your sheep. Please take care of me -_- and please preach pretrib premil Rapture. )</p>
<p>Thanks to all of you who have been praying for this decision. Your prayers have been answered.</p>
