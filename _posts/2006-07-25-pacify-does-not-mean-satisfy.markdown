<p>the heart is constantly in a state of longing.  It must therefore be either satiated or pacified with something at all times.  If it is not satisfied it must necessarily be pacified.</p>
<p>Recently my heart has been in a state of overwhelming hunger.  No kidding. As a result, for a long time my heart was being pacified.  With what? unfortunately with a sorry type of heart food: musings.  It was a poor pacifier for me.  But when I came across this sentence in a book, I felt like I could breathe again.  This was a flash of blinding light after standing in the dark for a long time.  Yes, this one small phrase filled me to the top.</p>
<p>"Duty is only a substitute for love (of God and of other people) like a crutch, which is a substitute for a leg." - C.S. Lewis</p>
<p>You see, it was not even a phrase that one would expect to be a satisfying statement.  It is not an encouragment or statement of comfort, it is not a promise for strength or even a story of joy or victory.  It is only an idea.  But an idea is more than enough if it is strong and if it is pure.  Yes, one idea which is fashioned by a clear mind is enough if I apprehend it, for my heart to be happy.</p>
