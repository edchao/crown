<p>I am ...dying to see the beauties of Heaven and the One who draws me there.  Goodness. To know true and relentless peace, unfathomable rest, happiness that pursues the soul. And the flight of all fears. Where sunlight is glory! and its rays shine through skin to warm the heart. Lord thank you for leaving so many traces and echoes of the true things of heaven in this world of shadows so that we can see through them and be filled with hope.</p>
<p>Sigh. This is why I read Narnia over and over and over again. To open my eyes and heart again to the home that Christ has prepared. For us.</p>
<p>Back to the Bible for me!</p>
