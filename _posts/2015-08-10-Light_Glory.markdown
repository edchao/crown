Just as light is not valuable unless it is seen, glory is not valuable unless it is recognized. As light can be quantified by the distance and spread of its observers, glory can be qualified by the sum and status of its audience.

There is One ultimate audience. It is His approval that makes the greatest glory.

As Christians, we seek to increase this glory insomuch as we seek to increase God's joy in us.  In this way, there is no conflict between striving for reward and striving to please Him.  For the greatest glory is to please God, and to please God is the greatest glory.
