<p>I was at a friend of a friend's house some time ago. A very nice single Christian girl this one was. While I was wandering through her quaint little house I noticed a plaque on the wall. It was a short message cross-stitched into a square fabric and held neatly in a glass frame. The message simply said "I'm worth the wait."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but think. Shouldn't it say "He's worth the wait?" </p>
<p>I looked over at her. She laughed.</p>
