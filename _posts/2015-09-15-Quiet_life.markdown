> 2:1 First of all, then, I urge that entreaties and prayers, petitions and thanksgivings, be made on behalf of all men, 2 for kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity. 3 This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, 4 who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

God desires all men to be saved. Therefore He encourages us to pray for all men, from our neighbors to our leaders, that they might allow us to practice godliness with dignity and without disturbance with the result that our message and behavior might win some to Christ.
