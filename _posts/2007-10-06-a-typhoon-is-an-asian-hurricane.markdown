<p>The wind is blasting the rain sideways outside. On top of the roaring wind you can also hear the shrill whistle of air slipping through small spaces, the heavy clanking of loose metal and the thick flapping of unpinned tarps.  I stepped out into the open street just a little while ago to enjoy the breeze, it's not everyday that a typhoon comes knocking on your door.  The power is exhilirating.  You can actually see the sheets of rain travel across the ground in linear currents one after another.  It's as if the ocean has been lifted into the clouds and turned sideways so you can see the ebb and flow of the tide hitting the concrete.</p>
<p>Anyways, it's pretty exciting stuff.  A bunch of my parents friend's called me to make sure I was okay and that I had food in the house, and always followed their questions with the phrase "are you scared?" "No."</p>
<p>I love it.  pure joy.  God is just wiggling his little pinky in the clouds to show us how massive his strength is. God is fulfilling his word today.</p>
<blockquote><p>“  Praise the LORD from the earth,<br />
Sea monsters and all deeps;<br />
Fire and hail, snow and clouds;<br />
Stormy wind, fulfilling His word;”<br />
(Psa 148:7-8 NAS95S)</p></blockquote>
