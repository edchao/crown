<p>Ok I gotta say, food in children's fiction is one of my favorite things to read.  I literally start salivating, but of course it's too late to eat since it's usually past midnight when Im reading.  Buy here's tonight's excerpt from The Silver Chair by C.S. Lewis. </p>
<p>"when Jill woke up next morning and found herself in a cave, she thought for one horrid moment that she was back in the Underworld. But when she noticed that she was lying on a bed of heather with and furry mantel over her, and saw a cheery fire crackling (as if newly lit) on a stone hearth and, farther off, morning sunlight coming in through the cave's mouth, she remembered all the happy truth. They had a delightful supper, all crowded into that cave, in spite of being sleepy before it was properly over. She had a vague impression of Dwarfs round the fire with frying pans rather bigger than themselves, and the hissing, and delicious smell of sausages, and more sausages, and more and more sausages. And not the wretched sausages half full of bread and soya bean either, but real meaty, spicy ones, fat and piping hot and burst and just the tiny bit burnt. And great mugs of frothy chocolate, and roast potatoes and roast chestnuts, and baked apples with raisins stuck in where the cores had been, and then ices just to freshen you up after all the hot things."</p>
<p>Good grief. That's what Im talking about. I should go to sleep or my stomach will start bawling.  Drool.</p>
