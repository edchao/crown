<p>I've been reading Narnia recently.  I love it.  Of course.  3rd time through and I love it even more.</p>
<p>I have 4 main thoughts every time I put down the book:</p>
<ol>
<li>Aslan is a flawed representation of God, which means God in his true form must be the most wonderful Person evarrrrr x billion. Just as an example, when the children first hear the name Aslan, they immediately begin to feel strangely exhilarated, as though a secret note within them has been sung.  I have felt this. I understand this.  And it is the greatest joy of my life, to consider and apprehend the person of the triune God.</li>
<li>Humanity as it exists today either does not notice or does not care to notice God in his reality. If I were Edmund, Peter, Susan, or Lucy, I think that I would want everyone to know the joy of knowing Aslan.  But not everyone does. And that is unspeakably tragic.</li>
<li>I often don't notice or don't care to notice God in his reality.  And that too is deeply tragic.</li>
<li>I want to care to notice.</li>
</ol>
