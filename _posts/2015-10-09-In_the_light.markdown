> Blessed are the people who know the festal shout, who walk, O LORD, in the light of your face, who exult in your name all the day and in your righteousness are exalted. (Psalm 89:15-16)


I love the beauty of this expression. See how the glorious radiance of Godâ€™s face is a direct manifestation of His Name, His glory, His Person. To walk in the light of His face is to live with the continuous enjoyment of who He is. And further more, by the beam of this Divine light, He illuminates for us a path in a world of darkness.
