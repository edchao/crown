I love the beauty of this expression. See how the glorious radiance of Godâ€™s face is a direct manifestation of His Name, His glory, His Person. To walk in the light of His face is to live with the continuous enjoyment of who He is. And further more, by the beam of this Divine light, He illuminates for us a path in a world of darkness.
