<p>O Lord,</p>
<p>Let this be a day of righteousness and purity of heart.</p>
<p>That I should see and enjoy in the blessings of your grace,</p>
<p>so your glories will be bright to me.</p>
<p>Protect me from the snares of sin and temptation,</p>
<p>O sleepless One, crush my sleepless sin.</p>
<p>And make me a pillar of good before those around me,</p>
<p>that those who see would consider and desire You.</p>
<p>Lord, keep me from forgetting the grip of the Cross</p>
<p>and the rescue of my soul.</p>
<p>Center my eyes on that precious point of redemption and repentance.</p>
<p>And do not let the wonder of your return fail within me</p>
<p>but let it grow into a feverish longing that perseveres until it is satisfied in your likeness.</p>
<p>Bless your church and those who call upon you in faith.</p>
<p>Answer prayers today O God, in provision of help or heart.</p>
<p>For my joy and the joy of your people, in Christ, the display of your glory.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
