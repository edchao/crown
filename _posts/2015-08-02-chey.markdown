In Psalm 20 God answers the call of individual saints for the sake of his anointed (king).  What is initially a hope for a divine answer transforms into certainty when the individual aligns with the anointed of the LORD. “Now I know the LORD saves his anointed. He will answer him…”

As much as we align ourselves with Christ the anointed King, God’s answer is sure. If we remain in Jesus, all His promises are Yes and Amen.
