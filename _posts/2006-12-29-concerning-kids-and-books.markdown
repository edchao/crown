<p>It was a cold day today.  The sky was grey, the winds were up and my ankles were sore from walking too much the day before.  I spent a good portion of the afternoon sitting in a coffee shop, nursing a latte, reading a relatively engaging title "Five View on the Law and the Gospel."  Due to a certain melancholy film that has settled over my life these past few weeks the book has been a welcome academic respite, albeit brief, which has helped me to flip on at least little light in my head in the midst of a growing darkness.  The bulk of the book is rather daunting, being composed of a number of exegetical essays (some more exegetical than others) as well as responses, and it introduces the reader to the five major stances on the position and practice of the Law pre and post-cross for the saint of the period.</p>
<p>I don't want to talk about the book as much as I want to talk about the effect it had on me this afternoon.  To put it simply, after I left the coffee shop, only moments after the door closed behind me, the little light that was switched on when my mind started tackling the material, was switched off.  What followed was like one of those sighs you let out after watching the brown volvo station wagon, which you thought was your mom coming to pick you up, dissapear around the curve.  You sort of knew it would happen but were hoping it wouldn't.</p>
<p>After helping a woman pick up a lone cucumber which had fallen on the ground, I walked down the steps to the underground railway, and got on the MRT.  It was pretty full when the doors opened so I had to squeeze myself in.  There were two or three stops until I had to get out so I just looked down and waited.  When I did, I saw there before me, standing a  little lower than my hip a little chinese boy.  Cute kid, was the fist thing I thought. He was holding on to his mommy's hand and simultaneously leaning on them, pressing his forehead against her fingers.  From what I remember, he was wearing a sweatshirt under a puffy green jacket with fur around the hood.  I think he had a little scarf too.  He was fidgeting and shuffling around as the train swayed back and forth.  In that moment, as I watched him do his kiddy thing,  I found a certain measure of relief, sort of like I did in the coffee shop with my book.  I knew it wouldn't last, but it was refreshing while it did. Seems a bit strange doesn't it? Well, what was so special? Yeah, the kid was cute, but what was unique about that moment was for a brief moment I was mentally and emotionally forced to think beyond myself.  I actually couldn't help it. Right then, I was thinking, boy I really care about this kid, I hope nothing happens to him.  I mean, the kid was helpless without his mom.  There he was, just a little guy.  He couldn't fend for himself even if he had an aluminum bat.</p>
<p>So as I watched him I became suddenly concerned for him.   I was even protective over him.  You know, In that moment, if anyone were to come a long and try anything shady they'd be in for a fist in the face.  This kiddo might as well have been my little brother, or even my son.</p>
<p>I stepped off a few stations later and the door closed behind me.  This time the sigh didn't come until much later.  It's a funny story isn't it.  Biblical academia doesn't move you as much as watching a little kid hold onto his mommy's hand.</p>
<p>I know it's a lame story because the whole thing with the kid only helped me get my mind off myself more effectively than reading the book and that's why the relief lasted longer. But I thought I'd tell the story anyway because people usually don't talk about this stuff and a lot of times we overlook the deep feelings that make us human when they surface in ordinary day to day events.</p>
<p>Well, perhaps I can close this little story with a verse, not to be cliche, but to make the entry actually meaningful.  You see, the concern I had for the little boy was very real, and it was surprisingly strong.  I didn't even know the kid, but as long as I stood there next to him, you could have fired a gun at him and the bullet wouldn't have traveled further than my chest.   Right then, I felt like I could pour out my life for the kiddo.  That's the backdrop, here's the verse.</p>
<p>“ How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How vast is the sum of them! If I should count them, they would outnumber the sand.” (Psa 139:17-18 NAS95S)</p>
<p>and one more, for me.</p>
<p>“ See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are.”<br />
(1John 3:1 ESV)</p>
