<p>I just got back yesterday afternoon from Shanghai.  During my time there lots of great things happened.  Here are the highlights</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Shau-Ru got baptized</strong>.  That's right, finally! She had been waiting to really become a part of a community of believers who could affirm and support her, and a church that would know her well enough to baptize her!  Hallelujah the Lord is faithful and Good!  We had brazilian bbq after haha.</li>
<li><strong>Celebrated gf bday and 2 years dating!</strong> woohoo!  we went to a wonderful mexican joint and ate the most intensely delicious churrooooos (dipped in kahlua spiked hot chocolate) and then went home and passed out.  (we had been waking up at 7ish to go to work...and had to wake up at 7 the next day too...to go to work.)</li>
<li><strong>Went to Expo</strong> and saw UK pavilion! the most amazing building evar. Ended up going to other pavilions too, mostly just to view the outside, but some of them had no lines, like N. Korea.  So I went in there and bought selected works by Kim Jong Il, volume 12.  Pretty intense reading.  Apprently S. Korea is "America's stooge?"</li>
<li><strong>Praised God</strong>, for the opportunity to go to Shanghai, He provided the payment and I got the blessing!</li>
</ol>
