<p><i>(This article is geared towards the conservative Christian, both theologically and in practice)</i></p>
<p>Christians should not be conceited.</p>
<p>We who call ourselves the children of God, the followers of Christ, the co-heirs of the coming Kingdom, often think that we exclusively are experiencing true humanity, as we float far above the rest of the pagan world.  But in this series of events called life we're actually all on level ground.  My fellow brothers and sisters, We are not the only ones who laugh and cry and hurt and feel deeply.  Depth of spirit was not introduced to us with the introduction of Christ.  Since the beginning of time, unregenerate people have know that they are deeper than chemicals and random selection.  The term "Christian" does not equal the term"Human".  Rather, a Christian is a human who has been undeservedly saved from his sins, he is innately nothing more than his fellow man.</p>
<p>There is a horror that I have seen unraveled in my own heart these last few months.   That horror is the assumption that non-Christians are less than human.  Of course this assumption never blatantly occupied the forefront of my mind.  And I would be appalled if I heard myself even whisper such a statement audibly.  However, buried under my thoughts and musings concerning my interactions with my Non-Christian friends, I have discovered to my shame, that at one point in time, part of me actually subscribed to it.</p>
<p>You see, in college, I distanced myself so much from Non-Christians that they became something closer to an urban legend than anything else.  Because of that, I dehumanized them, and when I read the Scriptures, my mind fell immediately upon the sinfulness of man rather than the humanity of man.  Here's what I mean.  The Bible calls Non-Christians "by nature, children of wrath and sons of disobedience." (Eph 2)  That is, Non-Christians all have a bent to sin, an inner nature that locks the will from doing things that are pure in intention and hence glorifying to God.  The Scriptures say that they cannot help it.  Plain and simple. Now, my conviction in the Scripture's truthfulness has not changed.  However, what has changed is my understanding of where I personally stand in that very verse. In the past I did not even think about my own position in the verse, but rather saw it only as a prooftext to the state of man before salvation.  But I missed the point.  Because positioned before those words "by nature..." are the words "We too were also."  Meaning, we who are Christians, in the past were no different than non-Christians... hence the call for humble gratitude, not pride... not distancing.  But I'm not going to stop there.  As I see it today, though we have been saved from sin, the problem of sin also has not been dismissed from the Christian life either.  As much as non-Christians struggle with the inability to do good without being tainted by sin, Christians also fall under the same diagnosis.  Truly, even when we are in the very act of repenting for our sins, sin is not absent from us.  The saying is true, even the best men, are at best, men.</p>
<p>So Christians ought not to be conceited.  Though we have been saved from the penalty of our works.  And though we have been reborn as it were with a heart that is now able to do things which are good (because they acknowledge and honor God as He Is), we still sin.  We still fail. Sometimes terribly.</p>
<p>Though we are different, Christians and Non Christians are of the same.  Though we may live differently, we all live together.  The people we walk amongst walk beside as well. So often we highlight the existence of "Sin" as the main characteristic in Non-Christians, rather we should highlight the existence of a "Soul."</p>
<p>Now, this is no call for Unitarianism ,or Ecumenism for that matter.  Rather it is a plea for Christians everywhere to consider the humanity of their friends who do not know the Lord.  Speak to them as you would like to have been spoken to when you did not call yourself a Christian.  And in your heart, believe the best... search for the good in them.  After all, your friends are not your friends for no reason.</p>
