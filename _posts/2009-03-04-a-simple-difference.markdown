<p>It's confusing sometimes.  When does friendship become dating?  And are they really even different? Isn't it a square vs. rectangle issue?</p>
<p>Well let's make it clear:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(Pure) </strong><strong>Friendship</strong> - Does not involve Mutual Romantic interest</li>
<li><strong>Dating </strong>- A <em>friendship</em> that involves Mutual Romantic interest with consent to exclusive social privileges.</li>
</ul>
<p>easy.</p>
<p>So if you think that guy you're hanging out with a lot is just a friend.  Doesn't matter what you say.  If you both like each other, and have a romantic interest in one another, and hang out with each other exclusively.  You are dating.  Congratulations.</p>
