<p>One of the most beautiful thoughts I have ever heard preached is this:</p>
<p>"I am not here to make you feel good about yourselves, I am here to make you so happy in God; to help you feel so good about the glory, majesty, beauty, justice, love, truth, and power of God that in it <em>you forget about yourselves</em>."</p>
