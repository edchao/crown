> For the righteous will never be moved;
> he will be remembered forever.
> He is not afraid of bad news;
> his heart is firm, trusting in the LORD.
> His heart is steady; he will not be afraid,
> until he looks in triumph on his adversaries.
(Psalm 112:6-8)

On some mornings, your devotions are higher quality than others. I'm very thankful that this morning was one of those where my devotions were very high quality indeed. Oh Lord, for more mornings like this. This text in Psalm 112 was especially helpful. You see, I've been having trouble with anxiety at work lately, where I'm afraid of almost every new email that will result in a new crisis that will snowball into more late nights of work. The fear is largely unfounded, the vast majority of the time it's a minor fire that is easily put out. This is what they pay me to do after all! And so it was so very helpful to meditate on this text, and remember that as a believer who trusts in the Lord, my heart can be steady. Because God. Simple, right? Admittedly easier said than done, but nonetheless, simple!
