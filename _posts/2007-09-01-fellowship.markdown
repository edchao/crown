<p>alright, I know I said I was going to Eastbay Baptist.  And I still might, but I went to my nephews church today for fellowship night and it was fantastic (and it was in mandarin).  It was a group of about 10 or 12 college age kiddos and the topic of the night was 1 Tim, a book study.  The best part was we didn't even get to the book yet! (that sounds bad but hear me out) The reason why we didn't hit the text right from the start was because we had to talk about (drum roll) Scriptural Authority! aaaaand Conservative Hermeneutics!!! aaaaaaand Illumination!!! aaaaaand Canonicity!!! aaaaaaand the older guy is going to a Reformed Seminary!!!! So long story short, I'm very happy that my nephew is settling for nothing less than the Truth of the Holy Word of God. (dance dance, jiggle fist in the air)</p>
<p>Anyhow, tommorow morning I'm off on and adventure to find this Eastbay baptist church of Taipei.  I'll let you know how it goes.</p>
<p>I couldn't bring many books to Taipei so I brought Culver.  time reading is redeeming time!</p>
