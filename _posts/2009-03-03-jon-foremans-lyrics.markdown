<p>I wish i could write lyrics like this man...</p>
<blockquote><p>In this world of news, I've found nothing new<br />
I've found nothing pure<br />
Maybe I'm just idealistic to assume that truth<br />
Could be fact and form<br />
That love could be a verb<br />
Maybe I'm just a little misinformed</p>
<p>As the dead moon rises, and the freeways sigh<br />
Let the trains watch over the tides and the mist<br />
Spinning circles in our skies tonight<br />
Let the trucks roll in from Los Angeles<br />
Maybe our stars are unanimously tired</p>
<p>Let the wars begin, let my strength wear thin<br />
Let my fingers crack, let my world fall apart<br />
Train the monkeys on my back to fight<br />
Let it start tonight<br />
When my world explodes, when my stars touch the ground<br />
Falling down like broken satellites</p>
<p>Let your love be strong, and I don't care what goes down<br />
Let your love be strong enough to weather through the thunder cloud<br />
Fury and thunder clap like stealing the fire from your sky's<br />
All that i am hanging on, all of my world resting on your love</p></blockquote>
