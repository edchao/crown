<p>(&nbsp;not a tribute to the TonyRich project)</p>
<p>&nbsp;In Taiwan there is no fellowship if you don&#39;t look for it.</p>
<p>I miss everyone a lot.</p>
<p>praise the Lord for His word. if I didn&#39;t have the Bible, boy, I dont know where&#39;d I&#39;d be and what I&#39;d be thinking.&nbsp; Reading it is like taking a big swig of cold orange juice after a 4 mile run. Stunningly refreshing! Taiwan is a dark place with dark activities and is populated by a dark-hearted people.&nbsp; It makes the living word of God something very precious to my heart.&nbsp; It has served as a stablizing force in my heart these last few days even though I have been dwelling on only a few verses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a related note,&nbsp;walking around the streets here feels like living between two worlds.&nbsp;&nbsp;Within me there is one reality and outside of me there is another.&nbsp; But the one within is ultimate and the one without is not.&nbsp; Here&#39;s what I mean, peal back the outer layer and beneath all the economic development, all the big skyscrapers, the high fashion and the good food, everyone here is&nbsp;dying and the world they are trying so hard to push forward is falling apart.&nbsp; But nobody knows it but me.</p>
<p>once again, this is not a tribute to the TonyRich project.</p>
