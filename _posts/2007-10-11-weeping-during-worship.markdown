<p>I remember weeping almost every Sunday at Church my freshman and sophomore year in college.  It was never because I was happy.  Looking back, I think it was because there, under the prompting of the word and the atmosphere of heart felt worship, I simply became utterly overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Usually, I felt a deep pang of grief.  The cause of which I am still not exactly certain.  I can describe it a little bit but I can't really land on one clean cut conclusion as to what was the cause.  I remember that there were many times when I would suddenly and painfully know and feel that I was not the man I should have been, that I was pathetically weak, and an unworthy example for Christ.  The thought "God I'm so sorry, God I'm so sorry..." would repeat over and over again in my head until I either cried myself out or was forced to refocus on something else such as the beginning of the sermon.  Other times, I simply could not remain composed before the reality of a Holy God.  Just to be present before the God of Israel and to know it, was too much for me.</p>
<p>I used to wonder after every Sunday, if weeping so idiotically like that was right.  At first I always walked away skeptical of myself, thinking perhaps I had just been emotionally charged by the music or the strength of the pastor's voice.  Was I still stuck in my charismatic past?  Or was my grief legitimate and God-honoring?  To be honest, I still wonder about it.  But one thing I know, and have concluded.  Grief in worship is Biblical.  My experience is not foreign to the men of Scripture who when confronted with the greatness of God fell and wept or trembled in fear.  Abraham, Isaiah, Job, David, Paul, Peter ... the lot.</p>
<p>What's very curious about it all though, is that through the fear, through the grief, and through the tears, deep inside my heart would soar.  Though the Holiness of God was unbearable, inside somewhere buried beneath it all, it felt like I was coming awake to the brightness of the Sun.  I don't really understand it, even today.  How could I be so joyful and yet so sorrowful all in one moment.</p>
<p>shrug.</p>
<p>Anyways, I miss it.  I remember Beland used to cry too when they sang "Prize of my Life" and Steve would always be taking off his glasses and wiping his eyes.  Sometimes, I wonder what they were thinking...</p>
