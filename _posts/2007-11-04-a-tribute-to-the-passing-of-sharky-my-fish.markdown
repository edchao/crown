<p>my fish died today.  I am very sad.   This poem is a tribute to him:</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>To Sharky,</p>
<p>You were a friend, you didn't know<br />
I didn't think that you would go,<br />
so quickly from this world of light<br />
into the bleak and bitter night.<br />
Life ends far sooner than we know<br />
and you have taught me that the glow<br />
of health one minute soon can fade<br />
and lively breathing soon can change<br />
to chokes and painful gasps for breath<br />
which soon gives way to final death.<br />
I watched you as you tried to live<br />
and wished that I knew how to give<br />
you health again and happiness<br />
but I was weak and powerless.<br />
The Only God is God alone<br />
Apart from Him who can bestow<br />
new life and hope and righteousness<br />
the way, the life, the truth, the best.<br />
Dear sharky, you were just a fish<br />
but even simple beings exist<br />
to open doors to understand<br />
the Name of God, the Great I AM.<br />
So though you may have never known<br />
how I am grateful to have owned<br />
a fish like you, who lived and died,<br />
and taught that just as God decides<br />
when sparrows fall in distant lands<br />
all death is fully in His hands.<br />
He is the cause of all our grief<br />
we should not hide from Whole Belief.<br />
May God receive the glory now<br />
and even dying fishes bow.</p>
