<p>I'm not planning on dying any time soon but I was just meditating on the verse "life is a vapor," and decided, if that's the case I might as well get started on writing my last words, just in case you know...yeah.  Well here we go:</p>
<p>&lt;insert tragic death&gt;</p>
<p>I believe in Heaven, so I will be using the word "am."</p>
<p>I am not remarkable.  I am not a genius.  I am not even particularly charming.  In fact, I am painfully awkward.  The only things that are great about me are my mistakes and my sins. The effect of my life will not make it into any history books and there will most likely not be a biography written about me.  But that's quite alright.  If I finished this life with faith, love, and expectation, as a genuine believer and a preacher of the Gospel as well as a display of God's truth I will have finished the race as I would have liked.</p>
<p>The death of most people is a time of loss and mourning.  But I hope my death is a time of celebration.  If you are still feeling the effects of sorrow and grief may the dirge now be dispelled.  Because for me, to die is gain.</p>
<p>Now, my greatest hope is that if I have already passed away and you are hearing these words, I will be in the presence of God laughing, dancing, engaging in whatever expressions of joy that are appropriate for the place, and you my dear friends, will be considering your own life as a vapor in the wind.  So what now for you?  (Wow, I'm dead already and I can still talk to you, that's awesome.)</p>
<p>The Truth of God speaks with each passing moment.  "Sinner, be saved by the substitutionary atonement of Jesus Christ."</p>
<p>and if you have already believed, know that the "fullness of joy" awaits.</p>
<p>Well, nobody likes longwinded speeches.  I'll end it there where it counts.  Consider well and may we all meet again in the courts of praise.</p>
<p>&lt;end&gt;</p>
<p>okay, so this entry was not prompted at all by thoughts of suicide or premeditated death.  So if I suddenly go missing or something weird happens, I didnt' do it! it was murderous intent! go find that son of a gun and bring him to justice!  phew.</p>
