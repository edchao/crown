<p>“Note the order men, the order is first to confess that we have sinned, and how we have sinned, and in what way we have sinned, and then to confess, I am a sinner.  So often I have heard men stand before a congregation and seek to confess their sins and all they really say is “well you know me, I’m weak, I’m fleshly, I’m a mortal, I’m a man like you, and I have my faults and I am a sinner by nature so you just have to realize that that’s why I acted as I did.” And then they sit down.  That is not confession.  That is not confession. True confession begins with “I have sinned”, and acknowledging that sin specifically before God and before His people when it is necessary.” <em>- Dr. William Barrick: Sermon on Psalm 51.</em></p>
