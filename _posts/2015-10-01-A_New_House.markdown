> …lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, and … be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth. (Ephesians 4:22-24)

Even after becoming a believer, your old self continues to be subject to deceitful desire. To embrace it is to make our home a rotting house. In time it will eventually crush us. We must replace it with new thoughts which effect new deeds. As the rotting house of our old self continues to crumble, let us labor to build up the new house of the godly man, created in the likeness of Jesus, and make our home there.
