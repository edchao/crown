> Transgression speaks to the ungodly within his heart; There is no fear of God before his eyes. For it flatters him in his own eyes, concerning the discovery of his iniquity and the hatred of it. (Psalm 36:1-2)

Sin has a voice.  It says “You’re not so bad, and nobody will know.” The heart that listens and believes this flattery is the heart of the ungodly. Yikes.
