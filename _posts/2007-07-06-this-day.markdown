<blockquote><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This day all His mercies are new<br />
This day every promise is true<br />
Father, help me to believe<br />
Give me faith I need to know You<br />
And trust You this day<br />
This day </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Who knows what tomorrow’s light will                      bring<br />
Tears to cry or maybe songs to sing out loud<br />
But only God can see that far away<br />
And He made us for living day by day<br />
‘Cause He wants us to see<br />
That the God that He’s been every day of history<br />
Is who He is this day </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">‘Cause You are the same yesterday and                      today and forever<br />
Through every season Your truth and Your grace never change<br />
Oh, Lord, I do believe that the God that<br />
You’ve been every day of history<br />
Is who You are this day</font></p>
