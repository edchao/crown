<p>I parked at Hollywood Video hoping I could work the system and not have to pay 5 bucks at a parking structure.  Came back to find my car missing. Hollywood Towed it.  Here are the two thoughts that have been in my mind since I got the car back.</p>
<ol>
<li>It's better to follow the rules and maybe pay 5 bucks at a parking structure then try to bend the rules and pay 270 bucks just to get your car back.</li>
<li>I should mourn sin as much as if not more than I mourn my loss of money.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks God.  I'm an idiot, but thanks.</p>
