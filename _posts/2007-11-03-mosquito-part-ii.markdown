<p>I made the promise "I will kill you," yesterday.</p>
<p>I kept true to my word.Â  I killed that maverick mosquito today.</p>
<p>I cornered it into my bathroom, locked the door, put on my contacts and smacked it around some until smashing it flat on my wall leaving a long smear of blood...my blood.</p>
<p>That's right fool, you tried to stock pile your riches but this day I required your life from you!</p>
