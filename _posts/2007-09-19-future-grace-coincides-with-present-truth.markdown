<p> I never thought about it that way but now it seems so obvious.  John Piper writes that the purifying power of faith Future Grace is based upon a delight in God, a deep seated Joy in Jesus.  But I have realized that our purification does not need always depend on the future or promises not yet fulfilled.  (btw, I'm sure he also believes this. I just missed it when I was reading)</p>
<p>You see, since the core of Future Grace theology is increasing Joy in God over joy in sin, we do not need to limit ourselves to joy found in promises.  We can extend our minds to present truths such as Theology proper too.  There's no promise in Theology Proper really, but what there is, is the sheer excellence of God in His own character as revealed by the Scriptures. And it is enough to lift your mind above the pitiful pleasures of the world into the heights of God.  You can fight sin by simply delighting in who God is right now.  See? you can increase your joy in God by just reading "God."</p>
<p>To put it simply, if Joy is our motivation, and God simply <b><i>is</i> </b>our joy, than anything that has to do with Him so long as it is true, is fuel for the fight.</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, I argued with Vicky about this my freshman year and I couldn't get myself to see that the greatness and magnificence and beauty of God was enough to break the chain of sin if it did not contain with it some sort of promise for future pleasure.  I was so stuck on the Future Grace paradigm that I couldn't see that there was (and is) a big chunk of present joy in present Truth.</p>
<p>Here is some Present Truth to fill your mind with glory:</p>
<blockquote><p>“   God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways, in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world. And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power. When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become as much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they.”<br />
(Heb 1:1-4 NAS95S)</p></blockquote>
<p>Hope will purify your soul says the apostle John.  But Amazement will too.</p>
