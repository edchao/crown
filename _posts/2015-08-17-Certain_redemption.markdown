> The LORD redeems the soul of His servants,and none of those who take refuge in Him will be condemned. (Psalm 34:22)

This is certainty. Not a single soul who takes refuge in Yahweh will be condemned.  All who seek safety in Him, must necessarily be freed from that hell-bound chain if the payment is the blood of The Son. We are free indeed.
