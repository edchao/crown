Taken from J.Oswald Sander’s summary of Bernard Montgomery’s principles of leadership.

The Leader must:
1. avoid getting swamped in detail
2. Not be petty
3. Not be pompous
4. Know how to select people to fit the task
5. Trust others to do a job without the leader’s meddling
6. Be capable of clear decisions
7. Inspire confidence
