> You are clothed with splendor and majesty, covering yourself with light as with a garment,
stretching out the heavens like a tent. He lays the beams of his chambers on the waters;
he makes the clouds his chariot; he rides on the wings of the wind; he makes his messengers winds,
his ministers a flaming fire. (Psalm 104:2-4)

Sometimes I need to pause and enjoy the grandeur of our God. Garbed in blinding glory, enthroned upon the hurricane. An entourage of angels like a ribbon of fire behind Him. This psalm casts a vision that makes the heart swell.
