The man who set his own sons on fire, who led a nation into manifold idolatry, who erected demonic altars in the very temple of the LORD...was a man whom God chose to save.

Manasseh, arguably the most idolatrous king of Israel is a lesson on the astounding extent of God's grace.  Beacause of him we know that there is no burden of sin that can outweigh the atoning work of Jesus' death.
