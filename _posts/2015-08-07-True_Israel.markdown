> But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For they are not all Israel who are descended from Israel; nor are they all children because they are Abraham’s descendants, but: “THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS WILL BE NAMED.” That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants.” (Romans 9:6-9)

How do we understand this distinction between national Israel and true Israel?

It has been helpful for me to envision the promise of God, which identifies true Israel, as a stream of water traveling down the branches of Abraham’s family tree. The stream began with Abraham, turned down the branch of Isaac, and finally arrived at Jacob. But why should the stream run down one branch and not another?

Indeed, both Isaac and Esau shared one father, yet only one was elected to receive the promise.  Here the stream of promise came to a fork and decided on the branch of Isaac. Why?  

The reason is two fold. The first reason is obvious, the stream turns down the branch that God chooses. It is His free and Divine choice. The second reason is that the stream of promise travels down the branch that receives the stream of promise by faith.  

And yet see how the two reasons are one. God’s free and Divine election can only coexist when the recipient exercises faith apart from works. For if it were works that determined the path of the stream, then God’s election would be directed by man’s labor and not by Divine freedom.

#### Conclusion
Today, National Israel is defined by its connection to the patriarchal branch of Jacob. And yet we know that the stream of God’s promise has travelled down only those branches which have received it by faith apart from works.  So why call the other branches, that have failed in this regard, Israel at all? It is because God’s intended recipients for His promise were all the descendants of Jacob (aka Israel), who are by their forefather named. And so today, as the majority of those branches of Israel have failed to receive the stream of God’s promise, we await a day when they return in faith to receive that which has always been promised them. Only then will National Israel becomes true Israel again. And it will then be as Romans 11:26 says, “All Israel will be saved.”
