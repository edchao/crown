<p>I've heard it on multiple occasions that when a Christian sins, he is being a practical atheist. An atheist does not believe in God. His very existence is rejected. And therefore there is no reason for the Atheist to follow what "God" allegedly says. "To sin" or commit moral offense then, means nothing but to violate a social construct developed over years of human evolution. The logical response for the thinking Atheist is therefore: "'God' shall not bar me from doing what I desire to do". Strangely enough, Christians think this way all the time. That's why Christians sin. They are being practical Atheists every day.</p>
<p>Now can I say that I respect Atheists who practice their mantra in that they are being consistent with their convictions. You see a logical atheist is bound by rationale to serve himself. If there is no God, there is only man himself, the throne belongs<br />
to him. If there is no God, there is no accountability or standard for any moral code other than what humans have derived through attempts to survive (which involve leveraging the collective whole through communal conscious behavior) Furthermore, the significance and importance of practicing human-conceived precepts are subject to change, improvement, and rejection within the sphere of human evolution. If I were an Atheist I would be a hedonistic egoist.   I would seek pleasure, survival and the continuation of my genetic makeup. I would be an egoist because self is all important if survival and the dissemination of my genes is the objective. All generosity or perceived kindness would be simply social manipulation (albeit psychologically rewarding) for my ultimate benefit.  And my seeking pleasure would essentially be the evolutionary mechanism to motivate my ongoing pursuit for stability in survival. Now much of this flies in the face of moral codes laid out through religion or society. But atheism bows to no greater power than the self. So such laws must either serve or come second  to self preservation.</p>
<p>Now I ask, do most atheists live like this? Think like this? Very few. Most atheists are genuinely nice guys. I'm not saying the consistent atheist cannot be a nice guy, he simply must be calculated in his kindness. There must always be a self-beneficial objective to the act. (It could be argued that the "feel good" experience then of showing kindness for him is simply an evolved psychological response to motivate this kind of behavior after it was found to improve survival.)</p>
<p>But you know what, I think most atheists don't feel this way. I think there are millions of atheists out there who genuinely do nice things without regard to themselves (mostly) ...or even despite themselves. In other words I believe in genuinely kind Atheists.  Haha. But this, at least to me, seems logically inconsistent. An atheist ought not to have such selfless sentiments. It is out of character. And yet he cannot help but to be that way, it is...natural One can argue that society has done this. But I find it hard to believe that a society born out of evolution would create truly selfless beings. </p>
<p>And so I find that many atheists are often practical Christians, blithely making choices that genuinely do not benefit their own survival, but rather sacrificially benefit others. That's the kind of behavior Christians herald. Self-sacrifice. Unconditional Love. Forgiveness. And so on.</p>
<p>Well, all this is of course just an observation. But I think it bears the echo of a greater truth concerning the original state of man, and the limited extent of atheistic convictions on the even the most confident atheist.</p>
