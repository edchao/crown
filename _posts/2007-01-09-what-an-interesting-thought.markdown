<p>I was reading this online article by the senior editor of Newsweek magazine, and in it he describes his struggle to understand physics and the general theory of relativity.  For me, it's already a jump to think about this sort of thing.  But it was comforting to hear a far more trained and intellectual mind say similar things.  Remember now, The principle of General relativity is that the laws of physics must be the same for all observers (accelerated or not).</p>
<blockquote><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Special and General Theory" was the prototype for all subsequent efforts                                   to explain the universe in words rather than equations. It marked the earliest                                   appearance of that ubiquitous character, the man on the train, a faceless stick                                   figure glimpsed through a coach-car window as he zooms past at nearly the speed                                   of light. Remarkably, we can observe him as he goes about his obsessive                                   tasks: bouncing a Ping-pong ball on a table, or shining a flashlight at a mirror                                   on the ceiling, or holding up a clock for us to compare to the identical one                                   we just happen to hold.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Many hours have I devoted to contemplating his                                   inertial frame of reference and trying to reconcile it to my own, standing motionless                                   on the platform. I have engaged him in my own thought experiments, even                                   conjuring a <em>gedanken </em>companion who                                   rides a train on the adjacent track. If they                                   each pass my position at the same instant,                                   traveling at three-quarters the speed of light                                   in opposite directions, then their speed relative                                   to each other is one and a half times the speed                                   of â€¦wait a second, that can't                                   be right, can it?  What I'm up against here is a problem in translation;                                 the laws of nature are written in equations,                                 but I read only English." - Jerry Alder<br />

<p>Have you ever thought that perhaps one day after you wake up from the grave, you will find out that all the equations you ever knew in your former life were just the failing sparks of something far more mysterious?  Perhaps the final state of physics will one day extend into the the metaphysical, even the spiritual.  Boy, who knows.</p>
