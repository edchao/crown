<p>I went with <a href="http://thehaucks.blogspot.com/">Sanny</a>, my pastor's wife this morning.  (just got back actually).   It's this long alleyway that's roofed off, packed with endless stands and goodies.   Here's the list of the things I got, I don't know how to translate it but I'll try my best:</p>
<ol>
<li>One bunch of A-leaf - 30 NT = $.90</li>
<li>One bunch of empty heart plant - 25 NT = $.75</li>
<li>A big bag  of garlic and good stick of ginger - 60 NT = $2.00</li>
<li>5 Guavas - 125 NT = $3.78</li>
<li>4 persimmons -30 NT - $.90</li>
<li>2 Kg of Lean pork meat (about the length of my fore arm) - 290 NT = $8.78</li>
</ol>
<p>That should last me all week.  All together it would be $17.11, that's not even 600 NT!</p>
<p>yesssssss</p>
