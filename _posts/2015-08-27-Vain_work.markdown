> I have seen all the works which have been done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and striving after wind. (Ecclesiastes 1:14)

> Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men (Colossians 3:23)

I had a depressing day at work today. Yet I take encouragement in knowing that God is not concerned with how fruitful my labor is. He is after all mainly interested in with how I honor Him in my heart. Itâ€™s not the result of the work that matters (that's vanity), but the attitude I uphold as I work (that's eternal).
