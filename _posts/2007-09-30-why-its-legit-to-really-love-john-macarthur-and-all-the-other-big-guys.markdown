<p>I have heard, multiple times that it is not cool to be such a JMac fan.  Or, it's so lame to be a Piper head.  Sound familiar? "Dude, I mean I know he's a great theologian but you act like he's Jesus!"  Really? If people saw MacArthur as a Jesus figure, I doubt they'd ever listened to JMac's teaching.  Well, if you love John MacArthur, chances are you love how he handles the word so carefully or you admire and want to imitate the stability of his faith or if you go to his church, you appreciate greatly his shepherd-like heart to the congregation.  One thing is for sure, you don't love him because he has saved your soul. (if that's why you love him, stop reading, you need to repent and give the glory to God.)</p>
<p>I used to snore to MacArthur.  Well I was also a piper head too and the dichotomy between the two is vast in their presentation.  Piper speaks with volume and visual charisma.  MacArthur is dry, and his voice is relatively monotone and soothing.  To put it simply, I could not understand why people loved MacArthur so much.  Maybe because I spent most of my first year bobbing for apples in the front row.</p>
<p>It took me about three years until I began to truly love MacArthur.  I used to think people were crazy to hold him in such high regard but I realized as time went by that it was because he taught with incredible clarity.  He took difficult concepts and made them incredibly simple.  And on top of that, he was faithful.  For decades he has remained the same, his hermeneutic has not changed.  His theological positions over controversial issues have not changed.  And when you begin to feel the stability of such a man and know that he is the one leading you and guarding you as well as your friends and your church, you begin to grow a deep affection for him.  People don't really realize it but MacArthur is something of a modern reformer, he is one of the main reasons for the returning popularity of reformed theology in the states.  Sproul once alluded to this in a sermon at Shepherd's conference, that MacArthur was like a Martin Luther of our day. It's an exaggeration, but not by way too much.</p>
<p>Anyways, to the point.  Why is it legit to love John MacArthur?</p>
<ol>
<li>He is a worthy hero
<ol>
<li>If your son looked up to John MacArthur, wouldn't you be happy? I mean, goodness, MacArthur is actually a worthy hero don't you think?  wait, what? are heroes bad too? Didn't Paul say "imitate me"?  that's hero-talk.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>He is uncompromising in his convictions
<ol>
<li>Ever feel like Evangelicalism today ebbs and flows with popular culture? John MacArthur is like a hunk of concrete on the beach that won't move.  He brings a great measure of stability to the confused craziness of popular Christianity.  From the No-Lordship kiddos to the Emergent movement, he's been through it for decades and well...he's sitting quite still.  If there's someone I'd like to follow, it's someone who knows where he's going, hasn't backed out on the course for 40 years and doesn't care if other people tell him he's stupid or a dinosaur.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>He is courageous before the secular public
<ol>
<li>Most people bow to the public.  MacArthur just sits next Larry King and tells him to repent and believe.  I'm down.  Thats Romans 1 to me, how about you?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>He is a shepherd of his flock
<ol>
<li>4 decades of faithfulness to the same church. Enough said.  I want to be like that too.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>He brings us the Word of God.
<ol>
<li>If there's anyone who deserves to be honored it is the man who brings the Word. (1 tim 5:17)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There is however a word of disapproval that I do feel is worth mentioning.  So a lot of people love MacArthur, Sproul, Piper... the main men of conservative evangelicalism today.  I don't have a problem with that.  I love to see how a flock loves its shepherd, or young men and women look up to people who really deserve being looked up to.  But I do have a problem when people applaud these men and do not see it as important to do what these guys preach.  They say they love MacArthur, but when was the last time they strived to live a life sold out to evangelism, unashamed and unembarrassed by the Gospel of Christ? They say the love Piper, when was the last time they really took seriously the war time lifestyle or devoted their life to dreaming and yearning for the pleasures of God and forsaking the pleasures of the world? They say the love Sproul, when was the last time they tried reading anything more substantial than Wayne Grudem's Systematic Theology?  We love to sing the praises of the heroes of the faith, but very few of us actually follow in their steps.</p>
<p>Anyways, if you love John MacArthur and people call you a MacArthurite, I understand.  You're not worshipping him, you just think he's super cool.  That's legit.</p>
