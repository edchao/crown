<p> I just watched Princess Bride.  Loved it. Don't intend to let any of it's messages or ideals get into my head or affect my life</p>
<p>That's how it is with all Romantic Comedies huh,</p>
<p>It's nice if you watch it for kicks but its poison if you watch it for wisdom.</p>
<p><em>(except for some of the killer punch lines: "I swear by the soul of my father 'Domingo Montoya' you will reach the top alive".) </em></p>
