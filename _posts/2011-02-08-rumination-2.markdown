<p>God the Father has no body. But God walked with Adam in the garden of Eden. The garden was a physical place. Jesus physically ascended into (intermediate) heaven and is now seated at the right hand of the Father. Intermediate heaven is also a physical place. So God, who is spiritual in essence can and does exist in physical space. Can God then be touched?</p>
