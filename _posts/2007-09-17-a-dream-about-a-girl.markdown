<p>This entry might be a little weird and even awkward (go figure) but try to take it with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>I was riding back on a bus from a GOC outing at some retreat in the mountains (everyone was there, mattlau, beland, harrison, steve was somwhere but I didn't see him, mitchell, jeff, peter...by the way there was an onsen for the guys later that night where I discussed a lot of my thoughts concerning this entry...).  On the bus I developed a friendship with a girl (who was the spitting image of Natalie Portman) that somehow right then and there became more than a friendship.  I don't know how, but we ended up holding hands and she asked me about the possibility of dating.  At that point every normal guy would have dived at the opportunity and said "Yes! let's do it!" But something felt strangely and deeply amiss in me.   I knew that she did not delight herself in the knowledge of God.  Subsequently I could not enjoy any of our conversations and our relationship felt shallow, dark, and tragic. I couldn't look her in the eyes and tell her that I was willing to go the distance with her.</p>
<p>My final answer was no.  In the dream a flood of thoughts rushed into my mind.  I just couldn't delight in a girl who did not delight herself in the knowledge of God and His Word..How could I spend the rest of my life talking to a girl who didn't care for Him? who didn't feel the joy of salvation or the expectation of Christ's return?  How could I sit at a coffee shop and just go off about ministry and small groupees or new things I've learned about our Lord?  No matter how pretty the girl was, how could I be deeply attracted to someone who didn't love Romans?  The answer came hard and fast: I couldn't, I can't.  Then I woke up and praised God.</p>
<p>That was my dream about a girl.  So for those of you who are Christians considering dating a non-believer (or a nominal believer).  Please rethink.  You have nothing in common with them except for the fact that you are human.  And that's not even enough commonality to bring democrats and republicans together.</p>
