> You are the light of the world....Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven. (Matthew 5:16)

Good works are not the light. "You are the light..." The good works are an expression of who you are, a communication of your renewed nature. Do not hide the light of who you are in Christ. Let your Godward character become evident as it flows out in good works.
