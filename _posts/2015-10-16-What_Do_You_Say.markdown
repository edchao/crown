Today, I woke up to the words "Honey, X just texted me, Y's mom just committed suicide."

X and Y are dear friends in our church, I didn't know what to say or think. Lucy and I prayed for them. She bought groceries. I brought them breakfast and lunch. I sat and listened. Justin came, we sat, cried, spoke words of encouragement to them. But at the same time, what do you say? And boy, did I see an example of pastoral care in Justin as well. It was so raw, I still haven't processed it all. Truly, when one member of the Body hurts, the rest hurt with it.

Lord, come quickly, this world is cruel indeed.

> Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord! 
(Psalm 130:10-16)

> The LORD is a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble. And those who know your name put their trust in you, for you, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek you.
(Psalm 9:9-10)

> And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.
(Romans 8:28)
