<p>Hello my friends and faithful blog-stalkers.  Top of the morning to you from the wonderfully polluted asian urban wonderland, Taipei, where every restaurant serves the best food you've ever had, and the people all smell like grandma's living room.  Where the icy winter winds drop to a deadly 60 F, and room temperature weather means the girls break out their scarves and fur coats.  Legit.</p>
<p>I've been wanting to write something as an update and have unexpectedly just thrown out some really lame poems for filler.  I hope that wasn't so lame as to completely drive you away from this blog with disgust.  I know poetry can do that to people, especially when it comes in the form of unpolished, almost adolescent phrases.  I hate that too, that's why most of my poetry is under wraps, because I really dislike the stuff.</p>
<p>Anyways, to the update.  Here are some photos of my trip thus far.  Not terribly exciting, but at least they're not as lame as poems.</p>
<p>1. Hello! isn't this blur cool or what. It took incredibly precise hand trembling for this effect.</p>

<p>2. I went ot 7-11 a lot with my big brother Jon.  Notice our obvious pleasure at being in a store that sells everything you need even at 2 am in the morning.  Their tea-eggs are the best in the world.</p>

<p>3. it was my dad's birthday.  He dug it. check it out, this is how mature people react to celebration.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dadcake.jpg" alt="dad cake" width="300" /></p>
<p>4. We had lots of family dinners. Here is one of them, the dude on the right wearing the red shirt is named guan guan. I'm his uncle.  He loves the Lord and raps and that little kid smiling really big above him is his little brother, check out that grill.</p>

<p>5. Here is a fat crab that we put on the fire and ate.  If you think about it, it actually looks like Predator.</p>

<p>6. We also visited a close friend of our grandmother (dad's side) my dad calls her aunt even though shes not related.  Check it out, she used to be very pretty.  Isn't this a nice pic? so classic.</p>

<p>7. here we are again with her, now she's pushign 90.  Amazing.  You can tell I'm excited, I mean who wouldn't be! c'mon!</p>

<p>8. We went to visit my mom's old home in bei tou.  I practically freaked out, it was so moving.  This is me and my brother playing at the park my mom used to play at when she was little.</p>

<p>9. And to cap it all off for now.  The best dessert in the world, it's better than cake, it's better than ice cream, it's better than Korean shaved ice.  It's Taiwan Snow slices!  fluffy and light and creamy and sweat and delightfully cold!  When I went back to America the first time I had it, I dreamt about it, it was that good.  If you ever get the chance, eat it.  You can find it at Sr ling ye sr.</p>

<p>Till next time friends.  Grace and Peace to you.  Isn't our God great?  Can't wait to see what the New Jerusalem offers now that I've tasted the wonders of Taiwan and they are truly wonders!</p>
<p>Miss you all dearly.</p>
