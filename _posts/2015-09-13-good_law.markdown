> For some men, straying from these things, have turned aside to fruitless discussion, wanting to be teachers of the Law…  But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully, realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person, but for those who are lawless. (1 Timothy 1: 6-9)

The Law exists to expose the sinful heart by identifying outward transgression. It does not exist to incite fruitless discussions or speculative musings. As properly understood, the Law is a partner to the gospel, shedding light on "whatever… is contrary to sound teaching, according to the glorious gospel."
