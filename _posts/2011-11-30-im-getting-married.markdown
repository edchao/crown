<p>in like 3 days.  woah.<br />
Soli deo gloria.  I do not deserve such an amazing gift!</p>
<p>You know, people never tell you that the days leading up to marriage are not wonderfully romantic or even expectant.  It's pretty much rush rush, busy busy, until the day of.  You can barely enjoy the fact that the day is rounding the corner.   Well, that's all for now.  Will update again when I have a ring on my finger.  </p>
<p>Still looking forward to the return of Christ!</p>
