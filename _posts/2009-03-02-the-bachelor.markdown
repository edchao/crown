<p>I haven't watched this show before.  and I haven't reallly watched it this season.  But I did watch the last two episodes.</p>
<p>So here is the lowdown.  Out of hexa women, Jason (the bachelor) finally filtered it down to two girls.  Molly and Melissa.  According to his word, he was "in love" with both of them.  And no wonder, he basically had a honeymoon with both girls for a number of weeks before he dropped the rock.</p>
<p>Anyways.  Long story short, he chose Melissa.  Yay? Well, apparently no.  6 months later, he came back and said that things changed, that the emotions weren't there anymore.  And that after giving Melissa a chance, he could no longer "control" his mind or heart, he was in love with Molly.</p>
<p>Here are my thoughts:</p>
<p>1. A man should not allow his emotions to control his <strong>decisions, </strong>especially the decision to get married.</p>
<p>2. Marriage is about <strong>commitment</strong>, solid and immovable commitment</p>
<p>3. <strong>The heart of a man will never be satisfied</strong>, don't expect marriage to be an exception (likewise with a woman)</p>
<p>4. Honeymoons should not precede weddings, just like <strong>sex should not precede marriage</strong>.  There's a reason why desert is last.</p>
<p>5. <strong>You can't take back "I love you."</strong> And you can't take back pieces of your heart.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Don't get with a girl who you know can be vengeful or contentious.</strong> If you marry her, she will make your life hell, if you break up with her, you will be destroyed.</p>
<p>7. Don't marry a man who is okay with emotionally investing in more than one woman at once. <strong> In time he will not want you.</strong></p>
<p>8. <strong>Men are fools. </strong>Women are too believing.</p>
<p>9. <strong>Marriage is not about two individuals</strong>, it is about three, one of them being God.  And it is in fact more about Him than it is about the other two.</p>
<p>10. A woman must be willing to follow, trust, and support her husband, but <strong>he must be worthy of her confidences.</strong></p>
<p>11. Both husband and wife, must be <strong>experts and communicating</strong> with the other party.</p>
<p>12. <strong>The Gospel of Christ is a Gospel of grace and acceptance. </strong>Marriages are meant to reflect that.</p>
<p>13. <strong>End it earlier before later.</strong></p>
<p>14. Marriage cannot happen until both parties consider the other <strong>more valuable than anything else</strong>, anything, except for Christ.</p>
<p>15. <strong>Don't get married for looks, sex, or stability</strong>.  All of those things will go. And none of them are guaranteed.</p>
<p>16.<strong> If you are unwilling to let go of something</strong>. You are not ready to get married.</p>
<p>17. <strong>The ring is only as meaningful as the man's integrity.</strong></p>
<p>ugh.</p>
