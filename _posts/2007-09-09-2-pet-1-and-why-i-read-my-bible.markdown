<p>How is it that we partake of the divine nature of God and escape the corruption that is in the world by lust? Peter spills the beans:</p>
<blockquote><p>a.“Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>b.   seeing that His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence.</p>
<p>c.    For <strong><em>by these</em></strong> He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust.” (2Pet 1:2-4 NAS95S)</p></blockquote>
<p>But all this hinges on the "for by these things"...</p>
<p>So then there are three possibilities to the reference "these things."  Possibility number one would be a reference to "everything pertaining to life and godliness".  Possiblity number two would be "the true knowledge".  The last possibility is "glory and excellence."</p>
<p>Well, it doesn't really matter which possibility the "these" refers to because all three possibilities spring from the Holy Scriptures.  It is through the Holy Scriptures that we find true knowledge, all things pertaining to life and godliness, and both the glory and excellence of God by which we were originally called through the Gospel.</p>
<p>Out of these things we are granted the magnificent promises of God which hold out greater and more fulfilling pleasure than sin's deceitful promises.</p>
<p>Just another reason why I read my Bible.</p>
