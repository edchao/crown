<p>When I was younger, I think my friends knew I was a bit better off than they were. I was always ashamed of that, and I think today to some degree I still am. It has always made me feel like I am running uphill against people's preconceptions. So  I try very hard to not buy stuff, 95 percent of my current wardrobe is populated by clothes that I acquired when I was in highschool / early college, the rest including my dress shirts and ties AND suit were gifts. I am now 3 years graduated and working.  I don't buy things very often either.  I think the last thing I bought was a usb microphone that I refused to purchase for 3 months before finally giving in since it was 50% off, and that was 2.5 months ago.  I've discovered that a lot of fancy foods are pretty bad for you, and so I've started to abstain from those too. Since my parents are a bit on the richer side, I've always believed I must have some genetic predispositions towards luxury just because I was born into this family, therefore I try my best not to ever treat myself to luxury (my restaurants of choice are In'n out, Pho Hoa, and Unamas without fail and even those I think is are kind of expensive).  I've never wanted to be seen as the self-absorbed rich boy, and so sometimes I still introduce myself as one in a very overdone manner just to kind of get it out of the way so that people can see I'm just kidding and it's all really just for laughs.  (It's sad though, because a lot of times, people don't pick up on that last part.  They really think I like bragging about the size of my house and the number of cars on my driveway. And  I always think, wow people either have an awful sense of humor or I am a really, really bad at acting.  Anyway, I'm sure there are a lot of people who must think that Ed is a serious snob.  Too bad really.)</p>
<p>Well suffice it to say I never want to live or act like I'm rich.  I hate the idea of buying stuff just because you want it and spending without budgeting or saving.  I think its irresponsible, and naive.  It's haphazard.  I don't like haphazard.  And God protect me from being a profligate steward of what He has given me.  But even after all this, I think people will probably still give me a sideway glance down the nose and say "(cough) but you ARE rich, look at your parents," as though I don't realize that my parents are rich.  Ok, yes it's true that my parents have blessed me abundantly, given me room and board and food for ages.  I never asked for it (it's hard to reject when you are a child), but I am deeply grateful that they provided so much for me.  So thank you thank you Mom and Dad.  And that is exactly why I want to buy my own place someday, with my own money, without help (and then treat my parents to fancy meals.)  That way I won't get people coming up to me saying, ooOOh your parents paid for half of it? haha, rich kid.  Barf in mouth.  That would be the worst.</p>
<p>Anyway, I suffer from this rich kid syndrome.  I think it's a good syndrome, it looks at money and says, my parents were rich, but I probably won't be.  You are in my life because of grace. I need to manage you to the teeth. generosity must be planned. purchases must be worthwhile and by all means live as though you will be jobless tomorrow.</p>
