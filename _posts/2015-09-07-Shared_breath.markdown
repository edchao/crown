> I said to myself concerning the sons of men, “God has surely tested them in order for them to see that they are but beasts.” For the fate of the sons of men and the fate of beasts is the same. As one dies so dies the other; indeed, they all have the same breath and there is no advantage for man over beast, for all is vanity...Who knows that the breath of man ascends upward and the breath of the beast descends downward to the earth? (Ecclesiastes 3:18-19)

At face value, this passage seems to attest to annihilation (i.e. this life is all there is for both man and beast). But upon closer inspection, we realize that what's being said here is not that this life is all there is, only that both man and beast must yield to the same fate: death. The key realization is that the word "breath" here does not refer to soul or spirit (As it sometimes does). Rather it refers to air/wind in the literal act of breathing. Both man and beast express life in that they breathe air. There is nothing superior about the breath that fills the lungs of a man versus the breath that fills the lungs of a beast, such that one rises to heaven and one descends to earth. As far as what happens after death, we have these preceding words to instruct us: “God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every matter and for every work."
