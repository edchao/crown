<p>is a very bad feeling.  Having long hair doesn't help.  Usually I shower at night which means my hair is wet when I get in bed.  Wet hair and cold air equal frigid head.  Frigid head equals sleepless turning. The best solution is to wear a beanie to sleep.</p>
<p>I read a news headline today saying that Taiwan is not getting colder, the cold is just getting more focused into a shorter albeit more consistent period of time.  This great fiasco makes me want to cut my hair short again.  But I must resist, if I am to ever achieve that mane of glory.</p>
<p>On a more solemn note, school begins tommorow.  On a more solemner note, I need to invest more into church,  they're wondering where I am these days.</p>
