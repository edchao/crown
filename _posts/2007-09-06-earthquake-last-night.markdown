<p>It happened while I was in bed.  I woke up randomly in the middle of the night, I guess I was coughing in my sleep and then the bed started moving back and forth.  I thought about getting up and being safe and standing in a doorway arch but laziness got to me and I put my head back down and passed out while it was still shaking.  It was kind of like being in a crib again I guess.  I'm glad my fish's water is still in the bowl.</p>
