<p>a shower of crystals, a midnight blue flickering,</p>
<p>I linger there, like a slow closing door.  thinking, dreaming, wondering in general</p>
<p>no more than I deserve, and certainly no less.  What I reap now is what I've sown</p>
<p>let's not pretend. I had it coming, and now it's all mine. Here's what I'm feeling:</p>
<p>Once I had everything.  At least that's what it felt like.  But now with one thing less</p>
<p>I feel like I've lost it all.</p>
<p>But I'm wrong right? the tick ticking of a watch is the small whisper</p>
<p>the wink, the slight dimple, that throws a spark into the failing embers.</p>
<p>a distant hope of a renewed flame, heat and assurance,<br />
when all is cold.</p>
<p>it's hard to believe in the dawn when the night has just fallen. And it's winter.</p>
<p>but can you hear those keys, trickling out those smiling scales, a jazzy blue and silver</p>
<p>and a warm wood and coffee undertone.  I think it'll be alright.</p>
<p>the dawn is coming I know it, even if the rain is still falling. Don't matter anymore.</p>
