<p>Today was my ...notice the above title...last day of work. Who would've thought it would be so touching.  We had a big lunch get together for it and it was the fanciest food i've had in a long time.  And when I said goodbye, the response was moving.  The Varien family is truly wonderful.</p>
<p>Unfortunately afterwards I got a flat tire and spent half an hour looking for the tire bolt key.</p>
<p>But soon after that I had korean bbq.</p>
<p>What a day!</p>
