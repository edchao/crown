<blockquote><p>"September Leaves"</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>my dear september, alive with light and wrapped in leafy mantel,<br />
windswept, standing in a patch of graceful sun, with tender care, you unfurl.<br />
and finite here, the breath of mortal circuits, speaks to none of distant grief.<br />
my dear september, we walk together<br />
the crisp sigh that follows every lingering step, both awe and silence follow,<br />
and whistling like a grieving ghoul, the harmony of winter's yawn.<br />
my dear september, the tune which plays beside me,<br />
fiery eyes grow dim, and a distant frost floats in the ivory heights, testing.<br />
I find a place to rest.  We sit and watch the light grow dim.  You rise.<br />
Your golden spine flickers with each breath and then breaks. Slowly at first and while I find my focus, without exposition, scatters. You refuse to wait.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>forgotten faces speak in silence, and a forgotten sun sets over a hazy summit.  I leave.<br />
the last days of so much life declare that I am immortal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dude, it's not even September yet.</p>
