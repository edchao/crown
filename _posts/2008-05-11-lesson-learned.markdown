<p>"A life perfect ain't perfect if you don't know what the struggle's for,</p>
<p>Falling down ain't falling down if you don't cry when you hit the floor,</p>
<p>It's called the past cause I'm getting past and I ain't nothing like I was before,</p>
<p>you oughta see me now...</p>
<p>Yes I was burned, but I call it a lesson learned."</p>
