<p><strong>People have two misconceptions about Mosaic Law</strong><br />
1. Salvation was by obedience/works under the Old Testament Mosaic Law<br />
2. Righteousness does not arise from obedience to the Mosaic Law</p>
<p>Actually...</p>
<p>1. Salvation has never been attained through obedience.  It has always been by grace through faith even under the Mosaic Law.  <em>The Mosaic Law was the same to the jews as the commands of the New Testament are for believers(Christians) today</em>.  The Mosaic law consists of commands to be followed out of love for God so that Israel would be a beacon of light to the nations.  They are not commands to be followed for the sake of earning justifying righteousness before Him.</p>
<p>2. Doers of the Mosaic Law will be justified (declared righteous).  This is true "For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified." (Rom 2:13).  However no man can be a perfect doer of the Law.  This is because the Mosaic Law was meant to set forth the unreachable standard of righteousness.  As such, it existed to point us to the righteousness that was made manifest apart from the Law in the person of Christ (who fulfilled the works of the Law).</p>
