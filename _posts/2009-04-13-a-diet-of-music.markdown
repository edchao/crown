<p>This will not be a long post.  But I was thinking about this in the car today as I drove home from work.  I was listening to a great song by Phil Wickham called "You're Beautiful."  I enjoyed it much.  Not merely because of the musical sensibilities that were so similar to my own, but also because of the substantial content and the theologically charged images it provoked.  Listening to that song was good for me.  Good for my soul and for my mind. Which started me thinking, if my ipod could be likened to a refridgerator filled with eats, what kind of food was mine filled with?  And I concluded that my music diet was composed of 60% candy (cool sounding stuff, ie ear candy),  10% alcohol (emotional sap music that makes you unstable after too much) , 15% water (marginally beneficial ccm and secular but christian sounding mainstream alternative/pop)  and  15% real food (theologically substantial and emotionally healthy music or classical compositions).  Now just as what is found in your fridge doesn't always equate to your actual diet, neither does the distribution of music in my ipod.  If I was to equate the actual amount of time I listened to music with what I ate the most in this wonderful illustration, I would basically be eating candy all day, with the occasional shot of veggies and meat.</p>
<p>I thought that was interesting.  No conclusions. just a note.</p>
