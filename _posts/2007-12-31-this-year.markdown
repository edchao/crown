<p>may the Lord return and take the Church home.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Just a few more days and I'll be going home,  Just a few more hours and I'll be flying.  It could be any minute now, that you'll take me away.  Maybe just a few more days...a few more days.  To you a day is like a thousand years and only you know when the clouds will clear, so let me not forget and fall away, because a thousand years could be today." - Matthew West.</p></blockquote>
