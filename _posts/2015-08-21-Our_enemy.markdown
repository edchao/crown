Satan has always seemed like a sidenote. Sin has always been the real enemy. But I recognize this now as foolishness. The Scriptures certainly do not write Satan off as small or inconsequential. He is the serpent of old, the father of lies, a murder from the beginning, who terrorizes the saints and shreds the souls of unbelievers. As Sin is the raging force, Satan is its most powerful agent. The devil is no joke.

I've been reading a good amount of C.S. Lewis and one thing I've been noticing is how often and how thoughtfully he examines Satan and his method of argument. Lewis often focuses on Satan's tactic of muddling God's word. This reveals that if we don't truly understand truth, we will ignorantly accept a skewed version of it.
