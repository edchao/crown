<p>I started reading this <a href="http://thephosfour.blogspot.com/">blog</a>.  It's a bunch of EBCTers who are here in Taipei serving the Lord and ministering day after day.  They are really really encouraging. Read it if you have the chance and pray accordingly.</p>
<p>I met this native guy Leo a while ago at the church, really great, kind, passionate, down to earth and humble guy and most of all a servant of the Lord Jesus.  What amazed me is how he came to know the Lord through the evangelism ministry of the church here.  Almost made me weep.  The action is still going on today with other people.  There's a dude John here who is currently sharing the gospel week by week with a girl named Jia Ning. Pray for her, John confronted her with the cost of discipleship today and she's thinking about it now.</p>
<p>Bryan is a korean learning chinese so he can share the gospel.  Remember him in your prayers too.  He's like Justin Lau at GOC doing ET, cept he's korean and is not obsessed with Mariah Carey.  Matt is working as a tentmaker and ministering in the church. He leads worship and is doing a great job.  Jammin with him and Bryan is vaguely reminsicent of jamming with MT back home. Both of them are into Mayer, yesssss.</p>
<p>Oh, and a new favorite feeling.  When you stand at the subway stop and the train is about to come but you can't see the light yet and you feel this really strong breeze that blows over you all the way until the train opens the door...  I love that feeling.  It's the feeling of arrival.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, when Jesus comes back, I wonder if there will be a breeze when the trumpet blares.</p>
