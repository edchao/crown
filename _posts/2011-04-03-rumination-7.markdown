<p>Heaven.<br />
The home of God.<br />
The truest song sings of you,<br />
The deepest longing is satisfied in you,<br />
The most precious of hopes is fulfilled by you,<br />
The reality that overwhelms the dream.<br />
Where light and glory are seen as one.<br />
Where creation is finally heard.<br />
Where memories of fear and pain are trampled by expectations eternally exceeded.</p>
<p>To sigh the sigh of everlasting relief,<br />
When all toil will boil down to one final joy, spreading ever deeper and always wider.<br />
To enjoy forever.<br />
And to find the object of enjoyment in the One who called us from afar. Our glorious shepherd and King. Jesus.<br />
Maranatha.</p>
