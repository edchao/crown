<p>Man was neither made for novelty nor routine.</p>
<p>Going to work and sitting around in an office is not what I was made to do.  It is downright boring.  I don't even have pencils to sharpen, just a chair to twirl around in.</p>
<p>You know, I really believe there will be no boredom in the Future Kingdom. There will only be lasting excitement. We do not have a novel God, he is not "cool" today and lame tommorow. His perpetual excellence, will always be fresh and it will be enough to feed our imaginations for the rest of eternity. And standing in the presence of God will never become something we get used to, because the reaction of a finite being to an infinite being calls for an endless and ever changing response. Finitude must sprint to keep up with Infinitude and it just can't.</p>
<p>that's a comfort to me.</p>
