<p>“      But I, O LORD, cry to you;<br />
in the morning my prayer comes before you.<br />
O LORD, why do you cast my soul away?<br />
Why do you hide your face from me?<br />
Afflicted and close to death from my youth up,<br />
I suffer your terrors; I am helpless.*<br />
Your wrath has swept over me;<br />
your dreadful assaults destroy me.<br />
They surround me like a flood all day long;<br />
they close in on me together.<br />
You have caused my beloved and my friend to shun me;<br />
my companions have become darkness.*”<br />
(Psa 88:13-18 ESV)</p>
<p>This psalm is difficult to read because God refuses to relent in bringing suffering even when the psalmist cries for mercy.  But at the same time I think we all understand.  God does not always take away his hand of discipline, nor does he promise that our sufferings will end in this life time.  But despite this fact, we ought to still be like the psalmist, recognizing that God is still the God of salvation as well as the one who reigns as the sovereign over our grief.</p>
<p>This psalm just goes to show, sometimes God says "No" and we just have to bear with it.</p>
