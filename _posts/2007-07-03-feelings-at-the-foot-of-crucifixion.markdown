<p>I had a series of 4 dreams the other day while I was napping.  Each dream was like a short story, with its own ending, and its own lesson.  In those four dreams, four separate and specific sins were highlighted in my life.  I don't trust having dreams tell you the will of God.  But this was really something else.</p>
<p>Recently I have been confronted over and over again from the Scriptures concerning specific sins in my life whether in sermons, testimonies or in personal studies.  The repetition of these confrontations must have pushed the convictions into my dreams.  I didn't want to deal with them seriously in reality and in daily life, so I guess the Lord placed them into my lap when I was sleeping.</p>
<p>When I woke up, I trembled.  There was a sense of great Holiness, a feeling of complete unworthiness, and the unmistakable pull either of gravity or of guilt to crumble into a heap on the floor.</p>
<p>Ever since I started studying the book of Romans this summer, I have been trying to ask myself the question whether or not I really care about the cross, whether I really feel the significance of having my sin washed away by real blood, drawn from the wounds of a real man, named Jesus.  Do I really feel the unbearable weight of the payment?  Or am I finding myself becoming familiar with the facts of Jesus' death like they were just a chapter in a history book.  I try to ask myself these questions still, even when the situation seems completely unrelated.  Walking into my room, brushing my teeth, facebooking, checkign my email, driving to work... "do you care?"</p>
<p>In my room, just moments after I had woken up, there was no doubt, I really cared. With the burden of shame still on my shoulders, the sudden reality of undeserved atonement made me feel like my heart was being wrenched out of my chest. I could even feel it in my gut. I guess, the reality was too much for my body.</p>
<p>The theology of Romans should be this moving.  The facts we learn are the facts that have given us a second chance at life and a promise of perfect joy in the presence of God.  We all needed a Savior, and beyond all hope, Jesus came for us.</p>
<p>Are you full of feelings at the foot of the crucifixion?  Or has this all become dull.</p>
