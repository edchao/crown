<p>Just the other day, a member of our fellowship's mother passed away.  We prayed for her before she went but the Lord intended to take her home anyhow.  A little earlier than we expected.</p>
<p>I suppose there are a number of things I want to say about it all, for the sons left behind with no parents, for the painful love of the sovereignty of God, or even for the imminency of the call to repentance for those who have not believed like she did.  But instead I want to say something simple, brief, and to the point.</p>
<p>You all ought to know, she is standing before the Lord now, and what she sees is what she could only believe in before.  If I had only seen her before she left.  I would have asked her to say a few things to the Lord for me.  Yes, I know I can speak to God now, and voice every concern but sometimes my prayers on earth feel so unstable in my own heart.  Like I don't really mean them.  But I know that when you stand before God, it's real.  You can't be fake when your looking into the face of the one True God.</p>
<p>So if I could have, I would have asked her to tell Him never to let me go and that I really do want to be with Him.  That even when I wander, the world is not what I really want, but He is and that I'm so sorry for all the times I lived like He wasn't.  And while I'm here on earth, if he could make me a man after His own heart so that when I do see Him, I can run into the gates instead of walk.</p>
<p>There's more of course but that's the thought.</p>
<p>If there's anyone reading this who knows that they will die soon, please tell God these things for me. Thank you.</p>
