<p>yes yes, there are a great many new things in my life.  new job, new transitions, new places, new people, new ministry.</p>
<p>But the most important out of all of these is...</p>
<p>I am now a fan of Taylor Swift.</p>
<p>Yes, this 24 year old asian male loves to listen to adolescent country girl music.</p>
<p>More seriously: Life is hard, but in pain and brokeness, there is grace to be experienced.  Even through adversity, God's grace teaches, and makes Christ more and more the strength of my heart.  In a world full of opinions and voices, thank God, for the unchanging, uncompromising, Scriptures.  Year after year, He remains the same.   Faithful and True.  Whew.</p>
