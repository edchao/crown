<p>The word "sin" has lost its punch.  In Christian circles, to say "I'm a sinner," is not much of a confession anymore.  We can even sit in front of our brothers and sisters in the Lord, shrug our shoulders and say it..boldly.  No big deal.  We've forgotten to blush.</p>
<p>Here is how I remind myself of what it means when I say I'm a sinner.</p>
<p>I cannot count the times I have betrayed my God, my family and my closest friends. Behind sycophantic smiles of approval I have jealously coveted and cursed others happiness and wished to take it from them.  In the hidden corner of my eye I have indulged in fantasies too shameful to speak of and then scrambled to cover my tracks. And in those hazy corridors of my heart I have killed and tortured with the blackest hatred, pulling triggers, thrusting knives, and smashing faces into concrete.</p>
<p>So when I look at myself in the mirror, what I see is this: a spineless traitor, a cowardly thief, a shameless adulterer, and a heartless serial murderer ...  I am a murderer.</p>
<p>...good God</p>
<p>That's what I really mean when I say "I'm sinner."</p>
<p>Jesus, the Christ, knew Sin was nothing to shrug at.</p>
<blockquote><p>“You have heard that the ancients were told, ‘YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT MURDER’ and ‘Whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court.’ “But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court ... You have heard that it was said, ‘YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY’; but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart."</p></blockquote>
<p>Let's stop hiding behind the phrase "I'm a sinner," and start coming to grips with the monsters that we are.  It will make for humbler Christians and more genuine Testimonies.</p>
