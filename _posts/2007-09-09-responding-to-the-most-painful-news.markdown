<p>There are two emotions which happen.  First, a dropping inside, a sudden moment of falling and haze.  A dull and heavy lump of pain emerges in the deepest part of me. And then it slowly comes out, like a long sigh which takes all your breath away.</p>
<p>But then, something beautiful happens.  It's hard to put into words, but here is a excerpt from a journal entry, it doesn't really make sense, but it's something real and honest:</p>
<blockquote><p>" the news, it hits me, sinking, a sudden drop, falling for a moment...</p>
<p>But then, I can feel the clear and light breeze of Jesus, His open meadows and sapphire skies, coming awake to the the buzz of new life.  Fresh and exciting, a deep, clean, cool breath, lungs full, soul happy and safe.  Running over mountains, plains and crystal waves.  The sound or song of something so alive, so sure, so full of freedom and joy.  Blast my world open into a thousand blazing suns under the victorious shout of angels, or is it Jesus? My heart. No matter, I cannot think of it.  The glory of Christ overwhelms my shadows, sliding away and pulsing into patches of new light.  Hear all creation bursting into pure and unhindered joy.  Joy! Jesus hold my eyes captive with your ever growing, ever more radiant face. Is this love? Full and happy. O magnify Yourself over again in me my King.  My One love and hope and relentless dream.  come true! echo no more but deliver to me the source, the true sound, massive, strong chorus... here I am racing along your beauty, my sail is open and pushed by a great wind towards the center of this glory hurricane.  My deliverer, deliver me into the meadows of sun and light and grace."</p></blockquote>
<p>Lord I am so glad that I know You, and that despite the fact that I cannot touch the world or the state I am to enter, You let me feel it and it is enough.</p>
