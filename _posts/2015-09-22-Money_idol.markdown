> Make sure that your character is free from the love of money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, “I WILL NEVER DESERT YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU,” (Hebrews 13:5)

Money does not take care of you. Money does not hear your prayers. Money will not be your companion. Money will not watch out for your best interests. Money does not prepare a place in heaven for you. But God does all these things and more. So we can be content without money because in God we have everything.
