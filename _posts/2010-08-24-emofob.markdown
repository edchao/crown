<p>I always thought everyone was emo inside.  But after a few years of interacting with all sorts of people, I realized that the mass majority of emotionally-able people are fobs.  I will state no reason for this.  However I would like to make the observation that Chinese love songs are a lot more emotionally probing than American ones.  (maybe not true, and only because I'm Chinese...)</p>
