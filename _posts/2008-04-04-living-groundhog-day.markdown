<p>Groundhog day is essentially a movie about a man who gets trapped in the same day. That is, he lives the same day over and over again.  It's frustrating for him at first but then he learns to use it to his advantage to learn and perfect all sorts of sweet skills.</p>
<p>But what if that happened to you? What would you do? What sorts of talents would you set out to claim?</p>
<p>My point is simple. You don't have to imagine it. Life already is Groundhog Day.  The only difference from the film is you have to take responsibility for your actions and your body ages a bit.  But hey, that's a small price to pay for the perks.  The way I see it, everyday you wake up is still another day to get it right. If you aint dead, your turn is still in play.</p>
