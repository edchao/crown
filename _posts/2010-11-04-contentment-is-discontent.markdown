<p>Just a thought.  People who are content are not content to let their contentment stand still.  Just like any other virtue of the Christian life, contentment ought to increase, grow deeper, become more intense etc.</p>
<p>But how can you be <em>more</em> content? Contentment has many handles by which various virtues help to push it along. Such as gratitude or faith. But these virtues are in and of themselves non-stationary.  Faith desires to increase and gratitude does too.  A greater faith and a deeper gratitude will produce a stronger contentment.  So what intially appears to be an inherently stationary quality  is in fact deeply mobile.</p>
<p>So when somebody says, why are you never content with where you are with God? or better, why are you never content with where I am with God? the answer is, because growing contentment entails growing godliness.  If you are truly content, there is an ever increasing river of faith behind it!</p>
