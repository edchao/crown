> â€¦the church, which is the body (of Him), which is the fullness of (Him) who fills all in all. (Ephesians 1:22-23)

Jesus fills. And the Church is His fullness.  He is the abundant One, and the Church is the manifestation of His abundance. Jesus completes. The Church testifies to the quality of His completeness. Jesus does the work. The Church receives and displays His work.  In all things, across all realms, Jesus fulfills. And we,the Church are the God-given example of how.
