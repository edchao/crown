<blockquote>Twenty-four oceans<br />
Twenty-four skies<br />
Twenty-four failures<br />
And twenty-four tries<br />
Twenty-four finds me<br />
In twenty-fourth place<br />
With twenty-four drop outs<br />
At the end of the day .<br />
Life is not what I thought it was<br />
Twenty-four hours ago<br />
Still I'm singing 'Spirit,<br />
take me up in arms with You'<br />
And I'm not who I thought I was<br />
Twenty-four hours ago<br />
Still I'm singing 'Spirit,<br />
take me up in arms with You' .<br />
There's twenty-four reasons<br />
To admit that I'm wrong<br />
With all my excuses<br />
Still twenty-four strong .<br />
See, I'm not copping out<br />
Not copping out<br />
Not copping out<br />
When you're raising the dead in me</p></blockquote>
<p>Whenever it's my birthday, I always get real depressed. Why? Because the man that I am, after 24 years of living, is still such a poor and broken wreck.</p>
<p>O God, I'd like to be the second man. now.</p>
