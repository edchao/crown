<p><span class="huge">Part of every misery is, so to speak, the misery's shadow or reflection: the fact that you don't merely suffer but have to keep on thinking about the fact that you suffer. I not only live each endless day in grief, but live each day thinking about living each day in grief.</span></p>
<p><span class="bodybold">-C. S. Lewis</span></p>
<p>But Joy also has a reflection: the fact that you don't merely feel joyful but also necessarily think of how joyful you are feeling when you do.  I not only live each passing day in joy, but live each day thinking about living each day in joy.</p>
