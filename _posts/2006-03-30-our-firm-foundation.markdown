<p>when all else fails, there is One unfailing.</p>
<p>These past few years, I've had alot of dreams crushed.  I wanted to come into college, start dating the girl of my dreams, get good grades in school, learn to study the Scriptures and deliver the truth in them to others, graduate early, learn all the programs and software, and slide immediately into work, get married, have kids maybe, go to seminary, and missions or pastoral work.</p>
<p> Well, the Lord crushed my dreams of dating, showed me how hard it is and how lame and sinful and did I mention self-serving I am, and broke me up twice after closing the door once before we even got together the first time.  He  turned my grade situation upside down, humbled me about how poorly I understand the word and how limited my reach of Scripture, opened my eyes to see how inadequate and unskilled I am at teaching, slowed down my quarterly schedule, taught me that my gift is not my intellect and programming is not my thing, let me catch a glimpse of the competition and sheer difficulty of getting a good stable job, completely wiped out any hopes of getting married early let alone have kids, and put my dreams of seminary and pastoral ministry on hold indefinitely.  </p>
<p> Now I'm thinking about grad school and possibly leaving behind my church, my friends, and my family for the East coast.  </p>
<p> God is my rock.  When every dream fails and every hope fall apart, the Lord continues to show Himself faithful and strong.  If it were not for the stability of the Sovereign, I would be lost.</p>
<p> Praise God that He has made Himself our Firm foundation!</p>
