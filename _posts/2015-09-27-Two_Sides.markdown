I’ve been reading C.S Lewis’ last book in his space trilogy. In it there is this theme of coming to terms with the reality of the war between light and darkness. In the book, those who are in darkness spend all their time posturing, adjusting their image so as to be accepted by the influential. They deceive and are deceived themselves. They either don’t recognize the spiritual violence that is being done to them, or they are knowing henchman of the enemy. On the other hand, those who are in the light spend no time in frivolous favor winning, the stakes are just too high. These actively look for the straight, the narrow, and the true, where few have found its path. And finally those that are caught in between almost always crumble beneath the pressure of the masses, or the pressure of their own self love. They are pathetically and tragically won by fancy phrases, and fancy faces.
