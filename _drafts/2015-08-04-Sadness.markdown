> Sorrowful yet always rejoicing (2 Corinthians 6:10)

Sadness is helpful and indeed godly when it strips away that thin veneer of superficial happiness. It reveals the truer state of things.  In this sense, sadness of this sort does not oppose joy but rather longs for it as noble men long for honor over flattery.
