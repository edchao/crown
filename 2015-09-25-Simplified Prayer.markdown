> For this reason I bow my knees before the Father …that He would grant you …to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God. (Ephesians 3:14-19)

This is a complex verse. Here is a pass at trying to simplify it. 

“In the face of tribulations, I pray that God would grant you resolve to hold on to Christ! So that upon your steadfast faith, your heart will be made into His home. And seeing as you already live each day out of a heart of love, I pray that you will come to comprehend fully, His love, which will lead you to experience the richness of God.”
